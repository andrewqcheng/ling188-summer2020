Your job is to remove comments on videos that are spam (unsolicited and inappropriate comments).

I've downloaded it for you and put it in the \"data\" directory. Note that this is a nice clean dataset; not the norm in real-life data science! I've chosen this dataset so that we can concentrate on understanding what text classification is and how to do it."

    "How are we going to turn our tweets into numbers? Well first, I want to do some quick preprocessing to remove some junk. To that that, we're going to use regular expressions. We won't cover regular expressions in detail here, but if you're interested in learning more, please see [here](https://github.com/geoffbacon/regular-expressions-in-python). For our purposes, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. We can use regular expressions to find particular patterns in text data. The text data could be an English sentence, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, Python source code, or anything you like. Once we've found a particular pattern, we can optionally replace it with some other text. **In this way, regular expressions are really just advanced \"find and replace\" techniques.**"

    "Now that we've cleaned the text, we need to turn the text into numbers for our classifier. We're going to use a \"bag of words\" as our features. A bag of words is just like a frequency count of all the words that appear in a tweet. It's called a bag because we ignore the order of the words; we just care about what words are in the tweet. To do this, we can use `scikit-learn`'s `CountVectorizer`. `CountVectorizer` replaces each tweet with a vector (think a list) of counts. Each position in the vector represents a unique word in the corpus. The value of an entry in a vector represents the number of times that word appeared in that tweet. Below, we restrict the length of the vectors to be 5,000 and the counts to be 0 (not in the tweet) and 1 (in the tweet)."
