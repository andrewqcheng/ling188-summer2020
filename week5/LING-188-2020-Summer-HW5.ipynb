    "## Introduction\n",
    "The data in this study was collected by David Durian and popularized by Keith Johnson's textbook *Quantitative Methods in Linguistics*. The data were collected using the *Rapid Anonymous Survey technique*: individuals were asked a question to prompt a particular linguistic variable. In this study, the researcher asked store clerks in Columbus, Ohio for directions, prompting them to say either the word \"street\" or \"straight\". The researcher pretended to mishear them, (\"Excuse me, what did you say?\"), leading the stranger to say the same word more emphatically. The researcher impressionalistically wrote down (out of sight) whether or not the speaker had said [str] or [ʃtr]."
