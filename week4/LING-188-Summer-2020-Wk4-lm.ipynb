    "_The data for this demo is a lexical decision dataset. It was elicited from 21 subjects for 79 English concrete nouns. RT stands for \"response time\" (in what I assume is a normalized scale, rather than seconds). Frequency indicates a calculated frequency for the noun within a given corpus. In this lexical decision task, subjects were shown a series of words (e.g., CAT, BAT, CART) and the occasional nonword (e.g., CAZ, BRIT, CHOG) and asked to simply identify whether the word was real or not. In addition to measuring accuracy, recording the response time can tell us a bit about how our brains process words, as faster (lower) response times result from faster, easier mental processing._\n",
