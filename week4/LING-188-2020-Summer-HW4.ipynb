    "## Introduction\n",
    "*Visual word recognition* occurs seemingly effortlessly for readers. However, research has shown that it is affected by words which are *orthographically similar*. When reading the sequence C-A-T, orthographic representations containing those letters are activated. This includes not only CAT, but also CUT, BAT, CAN, CATS and CAST. Generally, words which are orthographically similar to many other words are recognized faster than more distinctive words.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we measure orthographic similarity? Part of this assignment will involve computing orthographic similarity via the *number of orthographic neighbors*. This is the number of words which differ by an original word by only one letter (i.e. number of words with a Levenshtein distance of 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will explore in this assignment is SPALEX, the largest Spanish lexical decision database in the world. It was recently released by [Aguasvivas et al. (2018)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02156/full). For the assignment, you will use a small subset of this database that consists of the 20,000 most frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has the following columns:\n",
    "- *word*: the Spanish word in the standard orthography\n",
    "- *percent_known*: the percent of participants overall who successfully recognized the word\n",
    "- *freq*: the frequency of the word, as obtained from [EsPal](https://www.bcbl.eu/databases/espal/) (These appear to be based on counts of words based on occurences in film subtitles)\n",
    "- *trial_order*: the order in the trial that the participant responded to the word\n",
    "- *rt*: response time, or the amount of time, in milliseconds, it took the participant to respond to the word\n",
    "- *accuracy*: whether or not the participant correctly marked that it was a word\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the trial orders, reaction times and accuracy values are from different participants."
