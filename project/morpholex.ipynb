    "The MorphoLEX English database presents all the morphological variables for over 13,000 English words. This database was compiled by [Sánchez-Gutiérrez et al. (2018)](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.3758/s13428-017-0981-8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Words are made up of roots (ROOT), prefixes (PREF), and suffixes (SUFF). In this database, variables for every word's ROOT, PREF, and SUFF are followed by a number (e.g., PREF2) that indicates where the morpheme is in the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in this table include:\n",
    "- ELP_ItemID: Item ID from the complete database (of which this is a subset)\n",
    "- Word\n",
    "- POS: part of speech\n",
    "- Nmorph: number of morphemes\n",
    "- PRS_signature: Prefix-Root-Suffix signature (e.g., PREF1, PREF2, ROOT1)\n",
    "- MorphoLexSegm: morphological segmentation of the word, with the canonical allomorphs of each morpheme\n",
    "- X_PFMF, where X is either PREF, ROOT, or SUFF: percentage of more frequent words in the morphological family\n",
    "- X_FamSize: Family Size\n",
    "- X_Freq_HAL: Cumulative morpheme frequency\n",
    "- X_P: approximation of the morpeheme being in a hapax (word that occurs only once in a corpus)\n",
    "- X_P*: approximation of a hapax containing the morpheme\n",
    "- X_length: length in number of letters of the morpheme\n",
