    "Kuperman et al. (2012) collected ratings of \"Age of Acquisition\" for 30,121 English words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives). Subjects were asked to consider at what age they had acquired a certain word, and these ages are represented as means (\"Rating.Mean\") and standard deviations (Rating.SD). This information is widely used in child language development/language acquisition research.\n",
