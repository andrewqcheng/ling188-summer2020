this is June the second .
and Mary's going to tell about what Ross's done this morning .
Ross took his bath /.
mhm .
and he threw doo_doo all over the floor /.
mhm .
and when I walked in I saw it .
doo_doo doo_doo .
caca /.
poo , poo .
poo excuse me .
and .
I walked in and saw it /.
uhuh .
and I said "/.
oh_my_goodness !
mhm .
and Ross looked at me and he said "/.
oh_my_goodness !
and then he said /.
how did he say it ?
let's hear how he said it .
oh he mushed it .
oh my /.
.
he said oh no .
oh_my_goodness .
the goodness was mushed but the oh was clear .
oh_my_goodness .
and then he said "/.
oh my !
oh my .
was that clear .
it was pretty clear considering I understood "/.
oh_my_goodness .
and I was sort of listening .
mhm .
yeah .
and then he said "/.
oh wow !
oh wow .
I was trying to figure out what that one was but that was clear too .
it was clear enough .
uhhuh .
he doesn't say anything clear .
just now /.
he says don't very clearly .
no he doesn't .
he says unt .
he says du .
don .
well he doesn't say it clearly though .
he doesn't say don't .
pretty clear .
okay .
and then just a few minutes ago I gave him a piece of coconut which he had been pointing at and wanting .
mhm .
and so I gave it to him .
and he said thank_you .
thank_you .
Mary wants to tell us a story about Mike Spratt .
mine !
mine !
I think he means mine .
mine ?
mine ?
okay .
you wanna tell us a story about Mike Spratt now Mary .
please ?
oh .
mike Spratt came over .
and as_soon_as Ross realized that I'm not sure this is such a good story !
tell it !
huh .
as_soon_as Ross realized that Mike was there he began to bring him the Leggo dolls .
one by one .
uhuh .
and then he became became involved in a game with Mike .
uhuh .
this was very nonverbal !
mhm ?
oh I know he wanted all the doll back from Mike that was it .
after he gave them all to him .
so he'd take them one by one .
well at least he took the first one and then he'd put it on the window sill .
mhm .
then he asked Mike for the next one and Mike gave it to him .
dad .
dad !
and he asked Mike for the third one but Mike would not give him the third one until Ross put the second one on the windowsill also .
mhm .
and I guess Mike guided his hand that time .
mhm .
so the third and fourth time around Ross got the hang of the game .
so when people insist on him doing things he will do things .
yeah he got the game very very quickly .
I agree .
I agree it wasn't that interesting .
ehh .
ehh .
what was that ?
was that Navajo honey ?
ehh .
ehh .
why don't you get up and talk Ross ?

he wants to get up on the chair .
I'll put you up on the chair .
then you'll hush .
and say real words .
say thank_you .

something's wrong with the Hulk .
what's wrong with him ?
he's not Doctor David Banner any more .
why is he getting mad ?

and giving him bad instructions ?
yeah .
where did you get that idea ?
from ...
I told the Hulk that he was doing .
and the Hulk answered to me he didn't growl to me because I was good guy .
huh .
so what is the Hulk going to do ?
he's going to eat those bad little guys up .
the Hulk doesn't eat people does he ?
why doesn't he ?
I think he just throws things around Honey .
he's going to throw a car at the bad people .
right .
yeah .
so he wouldn't get hurt by them .
right .
how about that big bear ?
remember the big bear in Tarzan ?
he eat The big bear eats the bad guys up .
mm hm .

he's pretty big .
was he a bad bear ?
huh ?
was he a bad bear ?
no he's a good bear .
mm hm .
he's almost good as the Hulk he is .
but the Hulk is bigger than him .
but they're both bigger than we are .
right .
yeah cause we're littler yeah and they're bigger .
they're bigger .
and if we run into them we'll get real scared .
yeah .
cause they're very big .
but if Tarzan runs into them then what ?
then he'll talk nice words and since they're animals animals always listen to Tarzan .
why do they ?
cause Tarzan speaks the animal's language .
why ?
he learned to do that when he was a little boy .
why ?
cause he grew up in the jungle with a tiger family .
yeah ?
mm hm .
but did the tiger hurt him when he was little ?
no .
why ?
because the tiger took him for a baby .
why ?
was it a tiger or was it an ape ?
no the wolf hurt the tiger ?
anyway Tarzan grew up with the animals .
when he was a baby he didn't have a mommy and a daddy .
why ?
what do you want Mark ?
why didn't Tarzan have a mommy and a daddy ?
because he lost them early on .
there was some kind of a problem .
did they die ?
I think so yes .
oh .
they really did .

Ross said that "/.
Mommy bought some toys for me because she had the cost of it .
in other words , she had enough money to buy it , so he said she has the cost of it .
Rossie said that "/.
there are two Shaggy Tauntauns the Rossy one and the Marky one .
I said "/.
no that's the Daddy one , because we had been playing that it was the Daddy one a little earlier .
Rossie said .
well , I said no that's the Daddy one .
Rossie said , not Markie said .
okay , well Rossie said , anyway .
no he's bigger than him .
so I'm him and Marky is him .
no you say "/.
he is bigger than him .
he is bigger than him .
or he is bigger than he is .
I'm sorry .
he is bigger than he is .
he's bigger than he is .
so I could be him .
I get to be the big one and and Marky get to be the little one .
but Marky really likes to take things in the bath .
that's his biggest pleasure .
but Daddy if the strings get raw he won't able to snap any more .
but Ross Mommy didn't say raw she said if the strings get rotten .
no if they rot .
oh if they rot .
if they rot .
I see .
if they rot .
now that's different between getting raw .
if the strings rot .
do you understand what it means to rot ?
you don't know ?
it means first they start out and they're real strong .
and when they rot they start to get weak and they crumble .
so that's why Mommy doesn't want him to get in .
who ?
Marky to get in ?
Wompa .

doesn't want it to get in .
the Wompa's an animal .
but he can't get in .

you've got to figure out something .
what does it mean ?
Marky did that .
Marky did that .

go in here on the other side .
okay maybe we'll need some light .
on the orange side .
on the orange side .
is that where she is ?
yeah .
how do you know ?
on the yellow side .
because I looked at her .
okay .
she has a bump .
look at that .
well she's just turned a different way Ross .
just turned a different way .
why ?
it's the same gun .
the bump is just because it's turned in in her hand .
see you can see the bump on the side .
that's the difference .
no it's a different blaster .
you're right .
she's changed her blaster .
it's a different blaster in her hand .
you've got the wrong one there .

if it came with it it must be the right one .
you're right .
maybe we can figure out what went wrong .
no .
maybe they took the wrong picture Ross .
maybe they've got the wrong picture here .
maybe they made a mistake when they made the picture .
no maybe they made a mistake when they made the gun .
when they put it in the box ?

no .
the gun .
when they made the gun and they put it into the box ?
yeah .
and they gave it to you .
and they didn't do it with a bump .
do you think that maybe you made a mistake ?
no .
well who made a mistake ?
the maker that made the gun without a bump .
not the person that chose the wrong gun ?
maybe the guy who made it made it right but somebody chose the wrong one .
you don't think so ?
no they just put that ...
what if you go to the store and you're sposta buy Cherioos and and instead you buy Raisin Bran ?
do you say that the guy who made the Raisin Bran made a mistake ?
no .
you say that the person who bought the Raisin Bran made a mistake .
he should have bought Cherioos .
who made the mistake then ?
the person .
the person who bought it .
he made a mistake who made Cherioos .
no Mark .

I wish I was in that story to tell him .
to tell him .
yeah that would have been interesting .
and you could have told Yoda that he was making a mistake .
that's right .
do you think you could really get into Star Wars ?
wouldn't that be fun if you could really get in there and really be part of it ?
dad .
huh .
I don't like my new school .
why ?
because .
they don't play Star Wars ?
yeah .
yeah .
they know it but they just don't play it .
well maybe when you get some friends you can teach them how to play some harder games .
I wanna go back to my old school .
do you think that these kids are too old for you ?
maybe these kids that you're in with are pretty big kids aren't they ?
have you ever played with really big kids like this before ?
.
the thing is that I don't like about this school ...
okay let's hear you don't like .
go ahead .
is that five year olds come and bother us .
do they really ?
yeah .
and you really get angry .
you do ?
yeah .
what do the five year olds do ?
they mess up and beat .
they beat on you ?
they beat on words .
they beat your words .
that isn't fair at all is it ?
no .
what do you mean they beat your words ?
they mess our words up .
.
the big five year olds do that right ?
yeah .
you know what you can do ?
what ?
go back to my old school .
well that's one thing you can do .
you know else you can do ?
what ?
you can get the four year olds all organized okay ?
get them into a a little group .
get all the four year olds so they can figure out how to get those five year olds to stop it .
what you needta do is get a bunch of friends and then if those five year olds come by and bother you you guys can work together and stop them .
hide from them .
hide or play tricks on them .
play tricks on the five year olds .
yeah and stay away from them .
you can stay away but I think the best idea is to play tricks on them .
yeah .
say "/.
you five year olds are going to be the losers .
I have a better idea .
we're going to play trick on you .
I have a better idea .
petition .
the four year olds can petition to have the five year olds removed .
and sometimes they are going .
that would scare them away .
that would scare them away .
oh Ross .
get all of your bunch to figure out a plan .
okay can you do that that tomorrow ?
get all of your kids to figure out a plan against the five year olds okay ?
dad you know what the good thing I like about what you should do ?
you stand and tell them and they say "/.
we're going to really shoot you .
then you go over to the other side then you walk over to the other side then you say boo .
that would work really good .
do they really have real guns ?
do those those five year olds really have guns ?
actually no .
she was escaping through that door .
and I pointed to it .
and she got out it .
Ross what actually happened to the cat ?

and then she went outside .

he also knows that if he says that ...
that he wouldn't get it .
that he'd be in less of a position to say so .

I can only go there with my socks no .
oh so if you're barefoot or with shoes on you can only go when but with socks no .
if you're barefoot or if you have shoes on you can go in there .
ya because you might ...
but if you socks on you cant go in there .
ya because you might slide and get hurt .

what is that ?
bologna and mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it's not Marky .
oh .
it's not butter .
is that butter ?
no .
they're recording .
that's okay .
Ross it doesn't make any sense .
why ?
to say that the plant eaters don't have any meat .
is this butter ?
because their bodies are made of meat .
what ?
your body is made of meat .
then they have meat in them .
only if you eat meat .
you have meat in it .
yeah you have meat in your body .
even when you don't eat meat ?
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat .
you see you gotta understand something okay ?
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all over your body .
muscles .
muscles muscles are meat .
plants ...
you take plants okay you you see that apple sauce ?
no .
that's not meat is it ?
no .
now if you eat that apple sauce what's going to happen ?
apple sauce all over .
no your going to make apple sauce arms ?
no .
unless you want seconds or thirds .
in_case you want more .

which one did you say ?
what's the difference ?

I would hang four stockings by the fireplace .
why Ross ?
cause a pony has four legs .
right a pony has four legs .
very good .
could I ask for a glass of water ?
I wanna interject that I believe that this comes from you telling him that you didn't even wanna hear him asking .
not tonight but other times .
there has been quite a deal made over asking .
sometime I do I don't even wanna hear you ask for it .
yeah and ...
and so he asked could I ask ...
yeah and it sounds like a politeness form but it actually has a very obvious function may I ask can I get away with it .
well he may have I doubt I doubt that explanation .
I can't imagine but he you know ...
certainly certainly it could be supported it could be supported .

let's ask Mom .
what's the magic dogs name in Pop_eye ?
dad do you expect me to sit on that ?
no of course not .
your apple is asking for more sugar .
no it's not a house it has wheels .
it's a car !
not just any car one two three .
it's a limousine .
are you going to go to bed right after your bath ?
I really will I'm not lying .
how come you're going up stairs ?
because I wanna .
because you're a twerp .
yeah that's another reason .
right ?
umhum and then you said "/.
that's the main reason .
no I did not say that was the main reason .
you did so !
well that's the main reason ?
did I say that ?
umhum .
well maybe I did .
I don't think I did I think Ross ...
I said "/.
that's very good Ross .
so this idea of main reason is is something that he sort of inferred .
oh maybe I did say that was was the main reason .
yeah I guess I did .
okay I said that was the main reason and Ross repeated it .
you're right Ross I said it .
I thought you did .
she is a darling Mommy shaving her darling legs .
why are you using darling ?
in my knowledge I don't know .
what does knowledge mean ?
it means ...
what does knowledge mean Ross ?
I don't know .
you were about to tell us .
don't stop now .
not in my mind .
not in your mind ?
in your mind knowledge means whether it's in your mind .
if it's not in your mind then it's not in your knowledge .
cause if it's in your mind it's in your knowledge .
right .
except for feeling those aren't knowledge .
if you having feelings in your mind or ideas well if you have feelings in your mind those aren't knowledge those are feelings .
and then when they say "/.
use your noggin .
they don't really mean that they mean your knowledge .
I want it holding onto the bone .
how do you know that's the bone ?
how did you know it was the bone Ross ?
because I noticed it before you did right ?
yeah .
and he's right it is a kind of a little bone end onto the bone on the end of the sword .
here it is Ross .
dad can we sell some of these to Maria Lane .
mean while can I do something ?
what do you think I can do now ?
play an ice cube ?
what do you mean "/.
play an ice cube ?
ice cube .
oh you mean Rubik's Cube .
would you please take that into your bed Ross ?
I mean go to bed right now .
I'm going I'm trying to .
you didn't really want a real cat did you ?
yeah I remember a time when I said that I want a real live cat .
can I run the story ?
the toy won't die the real cat will .
what else Ross ?
what did you wanna say about a story ?
no you can't bring anything only bring one thing in there only bring one thing .
why did you decide that ?
that's a new rule .
that's like you can't go into the area when there's a square when there's an x on it that's a rule okay ?
daddy ?
uhuh .
can I take two toys ?
ah no .
you can only take one toy .
that's the rule .
why ?
because that's the rule .
I'm going to give him another one .
now if I could just get it off .
I'll give them a piece .
that's enough now Ross you eat the rest .
you see my penis .
yeah I can see it .
so what ?
what are you going to do with it ?
he wants to take it to show and tell .
by the way that was a joke on Ross's part .
although he might not have realized how funny it was .
daddy what does final mean ?
that means the last one .
you better come up with me and that's final .
yeah I will .
but I can't come right now .
okay that's final number two .
if you don't come then that's final number three .
okay Dad let's switch it around and do it the other way .
when I jump over good then you tickle me and when I don't jump over good you tickle me .
do you want your Bangus ?
he wants you he loves you .
right .
which was Ross and Icey .
right actually though but what interests me about that was Marky talk dialect which is "/.
he wants you he loves you .
he repeats things for Mark to make sure that Mark understands .
yeah it's sort of ...
he doesn't use big sentences with Mark uses nice clear little sentences .
you know Mark said Roshie to Ross because Ross says Roshie to Mark in that babytalk .
yeah right my name is Roshie right .
I'm full .
you're full huh ?
that was all I could take .
yes I think she's pretty even though she doesn't wear that stuff .
well that she probably does look the way she looks in the picture .
the big lie is that they are trying to tell me without saying it in words that I will look just like her if I use that .
well you still will look nice .
oh I farted .
don't say that Marky .
fart is not a bad word .
don't say that Marky .
that's not a bad word .
it would be most helpful if you didn't say a word at all .
don't talk with your mouth full .
great going Dad you saved Castle Gray Skull !

there's nothing I wanna climb up to get .
you know what ?
if I were a baby you know what I would do ?
I won't climb on anything dangerous .
what if you were a big boy ?

Ross isn't that right ?
what would you do if you were a baby and there was something dangerous ?
no if I were near something .
what would you do ?
I would not touch and not even climb on it .
why ?
because it might hurt me .
smart smart .
what if you're a big boy ?
still the same thing .
right good .
dad I have my fast running shoes on and they are baseball shoes .
is it too cold out here Ross ?
no .

if you talk baby talk words sound like that .
ET .

is that right Ross ?
right .
if you left all your toys in there it'd make no sense .
forever .
forever and it would make no sense .
why would we leave all our toys in there ?
well there's no reason I wasn't saying you should .
if we left our toys in there it wouldn't make any sense we couldn't play with them .
is that what you'd said Ross ?
forever .
umhum .
forever .
so he went back to my original proposition and restated it .
even thought he had not gotten it the first time around .
okay you guys stay home today Mommy and Daddy will go to school .
no !
oh okay we'll take you .
besides Mom's sick .

this is the boy Gelfling and this is the girl Gelfling I got it wrong .
why is this the girl Gelfling why is this the boy ?
because I keep the crystal in the back of him .
right and everybody knows that the boy ...
no stop .
and why does that mean that he's a boy ?
get me a Hand ...
because the boy one has the crystal .
no Marky .
uhuh .
leave it in there .
because the boy one has the crystal in the movie that means that he must be the boy one because he has the crystal in his back .
I'm going to put it in my Pac_Man pouch not the one with hearts .
the other one with the heart .
this one right ?

hm doesn't sound like a very good idea .
it doesn't sound like a good idea Ross .
I'm not Mark !
I said Ross .
oh .
did you think I said Mark ?
yeah I thought so .
it was kind of silent I didn't say it very clearly .
yeah .
yeah .
you're right .
maybe you say it that you thought you know .
no .
maybe you heard it maybe I said it's on the tape recorder should we go back and listen ?
do you wanna go back and listen and see if we can find the truth ?
yeah .
very interesting maybe your were right and I was wrong .
hm .
who do you think is really right let's go listen .
we went back and listened to the tape recorder and we couldn't hear the difference it was sort of mushy .

but I didn't /.
it went whoops like that that's why I thought it was Mark .
right .
.
right .

I could tell them ...
I could take my little key car you know .

Ross is listening to Abbott and Costello and he came and he said "/.
I must be brave I must be strong .
and then some Indians came and took something away from him and he said "/.
and I must be nuts .
at first you won't think this is funny but at the end you think it it will be .
first the two cowboys found a man dead and they told Abbott that he killed that but he said "/.
no I shot over there !
he fell down here .
and then he said "/.
so who cares .
no no .
but he's dead .
and then another cowboy said "/.
so who cares .
so what did they do to him ?
nothing .
did they take him away they're not going to hurt him ?
good .
good .
Abbott said he might still drink on the dead man and then the the sheriff said "/.
why did you gun by him .
gun him down ?
yeah .
yeah ?
and then he said "/.
I think I just dropped a bottle on my head .
I don't understand do you understand ?
the the the second one that was funny there was Abbott in the park .
he said "/.
I am .
they said "/.
who cares .
and he said "/.

when he shot the dead man ?
no he wished that everybody didn't think he did .
okay now you're missing good jokes .

what are we going to do next ?
I don't know .
maybe some reading .
we haven't done reading for a long time .
let me think .
we could try to work on a book .
Marky can be on both of our sides .
when one person jumps one and then he jumps the other then he can take those two .

I've got to jump you now .
oh very bad boy .

why ?
after you jump you move and you hafta jump again if you want wanna move again .
you just jump over him and that's it .
that's all you can do you can't go any further .
why ?
because that's the way to play it .
you mean you can't get over here .
that's next turn .
you do that next turn .
oh .

I'm not going to cheat but I'm going to be sneaky .
watch this .
one jump two jumps see .
yeah so ?
.
there's a sneaky way to get me .
where ?
I'm not going to tell you .

that's not a a possible move .
you can't move backwards until you're a queen .
a King !
a King .
they're queens now .
yeah right okay go ahead .
I'm not going to give you any help .
they're kings and queens .
want me to give you a little help ?
you can put this guy here .
you're kind of trapped right ?
uhhuh .
you're trapped !
if I moved this one away you could jump and get kinged right ?
yeah if you moved him up here then that would be bad move .
you you hafta leave him there so it blocks me .
I'm sad because no one brought me a present .
but you didn't tell us .
yeah .
remember Dad it's the same as that Robin Hood time remember .
when you didn't tell us .
a new case of it is reported at school .

I just put it in my head and I remember it the next day .
Ross let's talk about whether you should give Sean the sword .
now why don't you want this ?
well why should we when I'm playing with Brian huh ?
to be friends with another boy .
dad but Dad !
now we can't do our hulahoop game .
you what ?
yeah .
but okay I understand what you are saying .
but then how is Sean going to feel ?
well how should I know ?
well think about how you feel when other have you ever ever been a kid and they don't play with you ?
other kids won't play with you ?
yeah but still ...
how does that feel ?
we don't feel too bad .
you don't feel too bad in that situation ?
no .
we go and get another group .
just find another kid to play with ?
yeah .
and don't you need more that one kid to play with ?
no .
what if no one with play with you ?
no one at all .
well I would just sit out_of the game and then I would just play play with my brother .
what if your brother won't play with you ?
brothers always play huh ?
yeah .
well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother wouldn't play ?
I would just go and eat something .
that's smart Ross ...
he's a smartalec isn't he ?
so you think Sean should've done that because no one was being being nice to him he should've just left ?
and ate some food .
that's a good idea .
so you don't ever wanna be nice to Sean huh ?
no .
how come ?
oh well how do I know ?
well how about Grandma ?
are you ever going to be nice to her ?
and you know why ?
she always pokes me .
she pokes you ?
yeah .
she doesn't always poke you .
well she ...
she likes you Ross .
yeah but she does !
grandma really likes you .
she does !
she buys presents for your birthday .
yeah but she still pokes me .
what if she promised not to do that anymore ?
she still would .
what if we got Grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then ?
still I know she would do that .
no but what if she really stopped it ?
she'd still do it .
no wait Ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her ?
she's so old .
but you're going to get old someday too .
yeah but not soon !
well how old is your mommy ?
how should I know ?
because you should learn how old your mommy that's how you you should know .
your mommy's thirty eight .
when you write on the the Mothers Day present for her and on her birthday present you hafta to know how old she is .
okay ?
okay .
are you going to be mean to old people ?
I don't know .
just because Grandma is old are you going to be mean to her ?
I don't know !
think about it .
why should I ?
I'm my own body so ...
you have your own body ?
yeah I can do whatever I want with it .
kind of but sometimes you hafta think about other people like like Sean and Grandma and ...
yeah but still why do I hafta do that huh ?
no one makes you and you shouldn't yell .
then why if no ones makes it doesn't make and why do I hafta ?
because I'll tell you the reason .
do you remember about about God ?

yes and still why do I hafta do it ?
you don't believe in God ?
uhuh .
okay well then what makes you wanna be nice to other people ?
I only play with my friends remember ?
yeah but what if other people were nasty to you ?
I wouldn't play with them .
and you wouldn't have any more friends .
so maybe it's a good idea to be friends with kids .
you know so ?
think about it .
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody .
let's think about a world where everyone is nice .

well he told some of me friends that the Fire_Monster and then they told me and I found out that they thought that .
and I said Maybe it's true .
maybe there is a commercial .
and you said be .
maybe what ?
maybe that they're showing the third one with Barry .
the third one ?
what is the third one Ross ?
the third set of He_Man .
the third set .
okay what are the first two sets of He_man ?
what what are the other sets of He_man ?
there is He_man and there's Tela and and Mer_man and ...
what set is this Ross ?
this is the first set .
and there's He_Man and Tela and Mer_Man and and Zodak and Skeletor and there's Beast_Man and there is Stratos and there is and there is Battle_Cat and there is the Battle_Ram and Windraider and Battle_Cat .
yeah you already said Battle_Cat .
okay and what's the the second bunch .
there's Many_Faces and Zoar and there is the Attack_Track and Triclops who trained to be a good guy but is a bad guy and Trak_Jaw that is just a bad guy and Fakir is in_between them .
what does it mean in_between ?
in_between your body .
how do you know that it's in_between .
that it's from the middle .
how do you know that it's in_between .
well how should I know ?
why isn't he ...
I'm just a kid !
why isn't he in the first bunch .
what ?
why isn't he in the first bunch ?
why isn't Fakir in the first bunch ?
Fakir ?
yeah why isn't Fakir in the first bunch ?
because he's the last one .
oh he's the last one to be in the first bunch .
he came when did he come out ?
when you told us .
uhhuh .
when you get ...
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch ?
I didn't know that .
at first I thought he was in the middle now I know that's he's the last one of the first .
he's the last one of the first bunch .
yeah and He_man .
but where do you see him ?
where do and when they make ads where do they put Fakir ?
they don't add him anymore .
they don't add him anymore .
and what is the third bunch ?
and what is the third bunch ?
the third ?
I think it's Fire_Monster and Flier_Bird .
but don't you think that Zoar might be Flier_Bird ?
no .
what does Zoar do ?
besides even a robot this bird would be different .
what would he be ?
he could be a stunt bird that flies and does stunts or ...
okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch .
oh ...
what are they ?
supposing I didn't know about them ?
oh you don't me to tell you don't want me to tell .
I don't wanna .
but you know something .
Ross that you didn't figure out .
what ?
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they useta have on the back did Fakir ever get in those ?
no .
are you sure ?
I'm sure .
and he never even did .
is Fakir in the second bunch ?
no .
so they never put Fakir in any of the bunches .
no .
yeah the did .
you made a mistake Ross .
when ?
at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak Fakir into into those pictures .
where ?
yup they did .
bring me I'll bring all the books down .
no it won't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we didn't save that .
why don't we get some new ones ?
how would that prove it ?
why don't we look at them and look at the backs of them .
where are we going to find that ?
where they sneaked them in .
you mean at the toy store ?
yeah .
I know how you can tell .
the toys have numbers .
issue numbers .
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers .
you can compare the numbers .
but the interesting thing is that Ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why I just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy Barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys .
I'm sure that there will be a third wave .
what kind of tree doesn't have those things you grow with ?
you mean roots ?
yeah roots .
an orchid .
no a raisin tree you know why ?
because it's the roots up .
no I didn't wear it today and I didn't paint on it right Dad ?
isn't he a terrible little brother ?
no he's not as bad as you think he is .
why isn't he as bad as I think he is ?
because he's just littler he doesn't understand .
but he does understand some things .
I do understand .
do you understand Mark ?
yes .
no he doesn't .
he does understand ?
what does he not understand ?
nothing .
no earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things .
I said does he know that infinity and four infinity and four makes makes infinity and eight ?
no it makes two infinities and eight .
oh .
and that is an unreal number .
that's a fantasy number .
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number ?
why ?
because you could never really get there in reality .
in reality you can get to infinity .
I know because your a person and when you get to infinity you're dead .
right because you'd hafta live forever .
right .
yes .
so it's fantasy .
infinity is fantasy .
good_night .

and we can't take the toys .
no but can take your belts off .
you don't get paid .
the only thing you hafta do is do them .

yeah like when I'm the calendar person I do that and when I'm the table setter I do I wash them good and everything .
and and book helper I'm good and there is ...
what's the best job to have ?
the funnest the most fun job is feeding the fish because you know why ?
it doesn't take very long .

no .
it's just that I like it .
daddy did you take down those stickers ?
yeah Ross I did .
they were messing up the car .
oh Daddy next time we get stickers we'll put them on again .
I sure hope Todd and his family don't get here too late and miss it .
if they do we'll hafta tell them about the exciting part they missed .
one of the guys disappeared just like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz .
it's just even worse .
daddy I don't to make the bad guys die .
who ?
Indiana Jones was making them .
oh really ?
yeah .
how about Marian ?
Marian didn't do it ?
something really horrible something really rough .
something with with people killing each_other .
dad like you think the A_Team is that way .
why does eight o'clock come after seven o'clock ?
you go one two three four five six seven eight .
you you count that way .
why can't we go like this ?
eight five six seven two one ?
people would get very confused if you went that way .
it wouldn't work out well .
you could make it up too if you want .
no I can't .
it's too late .
do they still check you for lice at preschool ?
no they never check me nowadays .
I think maybe they're over it .
Ross was pretending he's a servant , he said "/.
at your service my King !
at your servants ?
yeah .
at your servants , my King .
instead of at your service , right ?
which one is it ?
at your servants or at your service ?
servants .
at your servants , my King .
the real word is service .
I say servants you know why ?
no why Ross ?
I said it to it means at for from your service my king !
from your service my King ?
right .
that's cute Ross .
what is a servant ?
what does a servant do ?
kind of like a slave .
kind of like a slave ?
but a nice one huh ?
yeah .
and the king's not mean to him right ?
right .
and what else ?
I'll sleep down here like a slave .
we're the kings .
we're the kings up here and you're our little servant .
I'm the one that ...
you can't have any blankets servant .
okay you can have a little blanket servant .
if you're good .
there okay ?
we're the the kings right ?
but I'm the one that has glasses .
and I picked a blanket out_of here .
what happened here ?
maybe it fell .
maybe it fell maybe .
but I was up here and I didn't see it .
maybe a ghost knocked it off .
he's doing great Daddy .
good Marky good .
he really is doing well isn't he ?
when you were a little three years there were were some things you could do better than what Marky can do now .
like you could tell long stories about Star Wars .
that's because I thought that Star Wars was the master movie .
and when I was that age for Christmas I only wrote on my list for for Christmas Star Wars toys .
but I didn't get all of the Star Wars toys .
no and why is that ?
because they keep making those toys until the end of their life .
and when do you think they're going to stop ?
when they're when the people are all dead .
okay and how about when Return of the Jedi is finished ?
yeah .
and keep it for when they show the movie again .
and they'll put put the extras out .
I see .
but then we won't have any more toys .
we'll have more we'll have as many toys as you want .
Mark .
yeah .
you can have as many toys as you want .
isn't that true Ross ?
yeah .
mom did you know that this is one of the baby Care Bears ?
it's just that they didn't add him .
Ross you mean advertise .
it's just that they didn't advertise him .
but you don't want the why didn't they have babies Ross ?
they didn't grow them .
the babies didn't come out .
why ?
did they stay inside ?
yeah because they ...
I saw something in the corner of the box .
what did it say ?
I forgot again .
I don't remember it .
did you read it ?
yeah .
what Ross .
what about it ?
no grownups or little kids can look understand it .
and they they can't even see it .
I understand .
then how did you see it ?
well I could see those little lines .
oh yeah .
I could it was very little .
what does it tell you ?
that that the that the mother grown these bears .
yes .
which bears Ross ?
the pink ones .
yes .
and there's three of them .
I got one of them .
two more left .
are they just the same size and everything ?
well yeah but one doesn't have a mouth .
how can it drink milk ?
oh they the little ones don't come with mouths .
I see .
and are they the same color as the Mommies ?
no .
how come ?
oh because the inside of the mommies was pink and then they pink and and then they got pink and white all over them .
I see .
you mean in Mommy's tummy ?
yeah .
real inside where there was blood ?
well there's a little space where they could open a door and go in in and there was pink and white .
that's nice .
and that's where they came when they were babies .
right ?
yes .
is that where they grew ?
yeah .
well then did the Care Bears grow their babies ?
yeah .
inside them ?
yeah .
but you said they didn't get fat .
well not in the show .
oh .
but then later on after the show they grew them .
I see .
neat huh ?
so they can't have any babies on the show huh ?
uhuh .
where did you get the name for the little bear ?
remember I saw it on the back of the box ?
on the back of the box .
and the name of the bear is what ?
skyscraper .
skyscraper ?
yeah .
trust him .
my_goodness .
that is quite involved .
they call skyscrapers skyscrapers because you know how big skyscrapers are .
not big at all .
you know Dad you know how they call that big fat guy in Robin Hood Little John ?
it's kind of like that .
wasn't that a joke about Little John ?
yeah .
is it the same kind of joke ?
yeah .
see he's I mean he's and they call him Little but he's not very little !
do you think it's a funny joke ?
yeah .
what if I called you He_Man .
I wouldn't be He_man .
it would be a joke .
it would be a joke .
it would just sort of be because you're not really a huge muscleman yet .
no .
what if I called you Darth Vader ?
oh no .
because I didn't have a lightsaber .
I don't wanna have a helmet and I wouldn't be black all over .
but what if I said that I was just playing a game would it be funny then ?
yeah .
maybe .
but it would be like fantasy then .
it's hard to tell the difference between humor and fantasy .
where's my sun thing that hangs around my neck ?
up in your weapons drawer .
yeah but do you suppose that I hafta go all the way and climb ?
no I'll do it for you .
we can call the Weapon Drawer the Small Pieces Drawer .
how about that ?
I know .

let's get our covers up right ?
no covees .
covers ?
covee covers ?
I'm not feeling very good am I ?
you're not feeling very well but you are nice .
once upon a time there was two boys named Ross and Mark and they were were fighting with their feet in bed .
and and their Mommy tried to get them away from fighting .
then she pulled pulled Marky out_of the bed and sent him to his own bed .
and then they went out .
and Ross and Mark went out into the forest and fought with their feet .
and then a huge bear came up and growled at Mark .
and Ross called Joey and whistled .
and Joey heard him so he came running on a Landstrider .
he said "/.
come on two Landstriders .
and they were coming and Marky got on one and I got Rossy got on one .
then when they were charging they both got out their knives and stuck them in the bear .
he fell the and then they put them back in their pocket .
and me and Ryan rode all through the forest day and night until they got to a cave that led right to a treasure .
the treasure belonged to a treasure pirate whose name was Long John Silver .
he lived many years ago with his hand still hooked .
he never knew that when he went to the gold his hand would turn his left hand would turn back into his real hand again .
so he went into the cave and saw them and they opened the treasure chest and it made his hand better and he said "/.

the story of Jedi Mark .

ssh Mark .
once upon a time a long time ago in outer space there was this this little planet full of trees and mountains .
there are these little creatures there who live in these little tents .
they were called Ewoks .
ewoks .
the planet of the Ewoks had been very old .
the Ewoks had made many .
very many very less burners there because they loved the beautiful smell of the air .
and they knew if they burned too much fire for their firecamp when they go out hiking in the mountains it would burn it would burn their special cave that they had under the ground where all the mountains were covering it .
they kept a little weapons up up in the little drawer in their little coats of fur .
when they were going out hunting to find firewood they took their little coats and put them on with their weapons inside so if any people tried to take them away they can scare them away from them .
how interesting !
and is there more to that story ?
yes .
okay .
and they have these little creatures to ride on named named .
they're named they're named Treestompers .
oh really ?
because they loved to stomp on trees .
really .
they eat the little Ewoks do not let them because they think that they might step on them by accident .
terrible !
so they so when they wanna step on trees they tie them to the trees instead of stepping on them .
one day when they were going up up in the mountains they put their coats on but the weapons their weapons fell out .
and they were riding up the mountain and a big blob of slime came rolling down the hill .
their and the little Treestompers did not see it rolling down their Wonder cave .
oh .
and it was heading right for their weapons when they heard a little squeak of a mouse that was inside .
they rushed down the hill and into the dwarf .
and the slime was heading to the to their weapons .
so_that he could gobble them up .
then they had little extra weapons that were kind of like lightsabers except expect when they pressed the button light didn't come only little bullets that can stop things from eating up the weapons .
so they took those little extra weapons out and aimed them at the slime .
great .
is there anymore ?
do you know anymore yet ?
yeah .
then they ran to get their weapons stuck them on their coat but they fell out the hole that they came out .
then that very night they hadta sew the bottom of their pockets so_that when they put their little weapons in they would stay that way in .
very good .
so the next morning when they went out to ride for firewood they this big planet called Mountainflade was coming was coming towards the mountains and trees of the planet Ewokstam where the Ewoks all was coming right right to smack it .
they went on their horses to the very top of the mountain that reached to the very top of space and they saw this big ball and it it was Mountainstomp .
and it was headed right for for their home to smash it .
so they took their little weapons and raised them right at it and shot it and it blew up into a thousand pieces .
oh good .
then some human popped out_of the hole and they said "/.
stand still still .
and the man's name was Han Solo .
oh .
captain of the Millenium Falcon and his copilot his Wookie .
his five foot Wookie was with him .
his copilot they call him Chewy for .
and they raised their weapons at them and they raised their guns at them .
and they said "/.
hey hey .
what's going on here should we shoot you or should you shoot us ?
and they said "/.
I don't know .
and then they they both popped up and screamed at each_other and ran into each_other .
and ?
that's it huh ?
no then they bumped into and said "/.
hey which one are you Han Solo or are you wicked like I am .
?
okay .
and then one said to Chewbacca she said "/.

and he said woo ?
and she said "/.
oh no thanks .
because she thought because he opened his mouth and licked his lips and she thought that he was going to eat her .
oh was she little ?
yeah .
and a little one one Jedi Knight who was still training popped up behind his his his two friends Han Solo and Chewbacca .
his his name was Luke Skywalker .
ah .
he popped up between them and then they said "/.

then one little Ewok said "/.
Chewbacca said he said would you please give Banana_brain .
and he really meant banana custard pie to slam his face .
and then Chewbacca gave it to him .
and he threw it right at his bottom instead of his face .
and then he sat down in a chair and he says "/.
oh baby come let me take a look at this chair and we'll make sure that it doesn't have any glue .
no way it doesn't have any glue .
and then .
okay but what happened in the end to the Ewoks ?
did you tell me me the part about them racing the motorcycles through the forest ?
and then ...
then then then they thought that some of the the Storm_troopers would come out with little Cy_cy motorcycles with with rockets under the seats .
so they took their little rocket rocket motorcycles and drove on them .
one little Ewok said to Han Solo he was called Bananasplit and he said to Han Solo "/.
give me a Bananasplit .
like to split them in my brain .
and he and he talks not really good and then he said "/.
here you go .
and he said "/.
thank_you .
that means "/.

and he said Splat when he splattered the pie in his face .
now is that the end of the story of Return of the Jedi .
no then /.
how does it end ?
then one Stormtrooper came out with a rocket motorcycle and the the little Ewok said "/.
do you want a banana split .
and he said sure and he asked Han Solo "/.

thank_you .

one sunny let me have it the one sunny morning a long long time ago there was a bear that grew many bears out_of its stomach .
when they came out she decided to make a name but she didn't know what to call all of them .
so she called them Care Bears because they were so caring .
and every one cared about them .
when she showed the farmer Mister Cloudfarmer he said "/.
heh heh heh .

she said "/.
uhhuh .
they came out_of my stomach .
and then the farmer said "/.
they're cute little fellas .
why don't you take care of them .
maybe they need some milk .
why don't you try that .
I think that they're about to be sleepy .
you better give you better give them some milk and let them go to sleep .
and then she said "/.
okay I'll do that .
and went into the house made of clouds and got Father Bear to take care of them and got got got in one cloudmobile and drove to the cloud store and drove back with ten of milk .
then the then she drove back home and gave them some milk .
they grew so fast she said "/.

maybe they have magic powers .
and Tender Heart Bear said "/.
I do have the power to make people love .
and Cheer_Bear said "/.
I have the power to make every one cheer .
and Friend_Bear said "/.
and I have the power to make everyone be friendly .
all of them said all of them said what they could do that because they had because their names were part of that .
that's how the people knew which one had which power to do things .
then doctor Freezingcold no good no good don't care nothing went into Icyland .
all the trees and stones and flowers said "/.

drive off to drive off to your house that looks like icicles filled with stuffing .
and he went to his Icy house that the rock said looked like a house of white stuffing .
he said that because this white stuffing looked like snow and the snow looked like the white stuffing .

what's wrong Mark ?
now tell us the story .
now which story do you wanna hear about the machines ?
yep .
okay about a long time ago .
yeah .
how did it start ?
I don't know .
you don't remember the story ?
you're the one who was telling the story .
well don't you remember part of the first part ?
when there were just cavemen .
uhhuh and what did the cavemen have ?
nothing but furs .
uhhuh and what things didn't they have ?
tell me some things that they didn't have .
oh and for their weapons they had big thick sticks .
yeah .
.
and what did they do with those big thick sticks ?
well they knock things over knock people on the head with .
mhm know what those things were called ?
what ?
clubs .
clubs .
yeah .
that's what they look like baseball bats don't they ?
yes they are .
.
okay you wanna hear some more stories about them ?
okay .
did they have slingshots ?
sure that's another tool they made they took a piece of skin from an animal .
yeah .
a real long piece and they put it into a stick from a tree .
yeah .
and then at the very back they put a stone .
yeah .
and they pulled it back back and then it shot .
zzz .
shot it like that .
.
or sometimes they'd wrap it around slinging it around and let it fly .
that's why that's what I do .
uhhuh they're both called slingshots okay .
were there any enemies there ?
in the old days yes .
there were many enemies to the people sometimes there were other people who were enemies and sometimes wild animals .
oh .
did you know about that ?
no .
that's true do you think they fought with dinosaurs ?
oh yeah .
no not with really .
why .
that's a mistake .
why ?
the dinosaurs were long before when the dinosaurs walked on the earth there were no people .
well I thought that dinosaurs lived at the same age of cavemen .
no but sabertooth tigers and wooly mammoths did woolly mammoths lived with the caveman and they were huge .
oh oh cavemen cavemen did live they did people did .
yes they were real they were real .
they did they lived when the dinosaurs there .
you think so .
they did they did .
that's just in Flintstones .
no no they really did .
how do you know ?
they were a monkey that time .
oh they were still just monkeys ?
yeah .
maybe so okay now .
so they were there .
so they were there .
okay now you wanna hear the rest of the story ?
okay .
okay now first thing those people did Ross when they wanted to eat they would hafta hunt and kill an animal and then eat the flesh that's right and that's of course a_lot_of work first of all right ?
right .
and also kinda yucky right .
yeah .
okay .
yeah .
but now how did they get out_of the caves out_of the stone age what did they do ?
do you have any idea ?
they made a hole .
no .
a passage .
to get out_of the caves ?
no .
you know what they did ?
what ?
that was very important ?
what ?
the most important thing of all .
what ?
fire .
they made a fire .
they learned how to make fire .
yep well why is that so why is that I mean why is that so important ?
would you guys know why is that so because they used the fire to make to make iron .
to make light iron /.
iron and bronze and metals so they could make metal they took the dirt .
yeah .
and they burned hot hot fires and the hot fires made the dirt into strong knives .
yep .
and into guns and into a shovels .
you're kidding .
no they could make shovels they took things and they made big tools with the fire that's why fire was very important Ross and Mark did you know that Marky ?
well especially for the shovel you know why ?
what ?
why ?
because then they could make their caves .
then they could dig caves but you know what else they could do with a shovel ?
what ?
dig holes to plant plants .
or they could dig underground and make a passageway .
or they could make a palace they could build big buildings you see .
or they could make little hole in a passageway .
mhm .
and they went up to the stones .
mhm .
and then they went into the stones .
mhm .
they opened up a hole and they go back far away the a other way and the rocks of the stones fall in and then they'll have their own home .
right .
like and then but they do hafta get some more dirt to fill the two holes in .
right and so these people worked very hard they made these tools and now you know what they could do next ?
what ?
they started to make machines do you know what kind of machines they could make ?
what ?
first they could make machines to lift things like big pulleys and things like so you can lift them up on top of the building and they made big huge wagons so they could carry things you heard about the wheel do you know what the wheel does ?
what ?
the wheel makes it so you can roll wagons with big wheels can roll down the hill .
daddy .
mhm .
now we getting to the cowboy part aren't we ?
we're getting close to cowboys okay ?
yeah .
and then all first we hafta go through do you remember Robin hood time ?
yeah .
okay Robin hood had arrows right ?
yeah .
and he had swords .
yeah .
and they had guns .
yeah .
no they didn't .
oh they just starting they were just starting making the they didn't have guns yet but they did have swords .
they had they had forest kind of weapons .
forest weapons .
okay .
yeah they had knives and .
okay now came .
and bow and arrows .
right .
they they weren't really like bullets .
no .
bullets .
because they didn't have gun powder yet .
yep .
gun powder came from .
so they so we are gonna call them .
middle ages .
no let's call them forest weapons .
okay well they had the forest weapons and they could build a_lot_of shovels and axes but they still didn't know how to make big machines and then came the time of the great machines and people started building machines to do lift /.
you didn't do go through Robin hood's time .
oh okay well oh and there was armor I forgot to tell you about armor .
oh yeah .
a knights in armor useta have masks on their head made of steel Marky do you know like He_Man and Man_at_arms have masks made of steel and they have all covered with steel .
mhm .
but those are still not machines they're just weapons and tools okay ?
well I know a machine that they have .
think of a machine what is a machine ?
in castle Greyskull you know that tv that Skelator has .
yeah .
well that's a machine .
okay .
so four forty four comes back that's a machine .
okay and then people said hey if we can make shovels then we can make guns and knives I bet we can make something really really fancy .
what ?
bicycles !
oh .
they could make bicycles and they could make all sorts of little machines called clocks they started to make clocks and all little pieces started to move around and then they made machines to cut up to cut up to grind flour and make flour and machines to go out in the fields and pick the cotton and then they made cars Ross and Mark they built cars .
now we getting to our time .
right now we get in to our time and they make cars .
yeah .
and they started to make boats with engines .
yeah .
and the engines went vrrooom vrrrooom and they really had machines okay ?
now we're at our time .
and then what happened next see if you can tell me the rest of the story .

good_night darlings .
I told Ross that it wouldn't be fair to cry just because I'm giving a Trono to another boy , that's Adam Just , he shouldn't cry because it makes me think that he doesn't want the other boy to have something nice .
and what did you say then Ross ?
what if you got the last one for him and I never could have got one ?
actually he said "/.
well just think , what if you had gotten the last one for him ?
you know , the set up of the double hypothetical just think what if .
and I never could have gotten one .
how would that have happened Ross ?
well you everyone comes all over there and there was only one left and you get that one and then I wouldn't be able to have one .
oh I see .
I see .
you think it might have worked that way ?
yeah .
mhm .
I see .
well maybe /.
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the Trono was for you .
and why did you think that ?
well because you were hiding it .
and you said I "/.
daddy you wouldn't have hided you wouldn't have hid it .
you said you wouldn't have hided it or wouldn't have hid if it had been for me .
isn't that what you said ?
how did you say it Ross ?
it was "/.
you would have .
and you weren't hiding it from me .
so it has to be mine .
but you said /.
because it was yours I would have hid it away ?
yeah but it's somebody else's .
somebody /.
do you think it's somebody else's ?
uhuh .
why do you think that ?
well because you said so .
you said it was /.
no no !
for somebody else .
okay you say that you think it's for you .
yeah but /.
why do you think it's for you ?
well because in the first place I did .
and why did you think so in the first place ?
what was the reason ?
because if you were hiding it from me then then it would be sure to be .
no the reason was that you said that I didn't tell you who it was for .
yeah .
if I was hiding it from you then it was sure to be yours because if it was for Adam I wouldn't try to hide it , would I ?
right .
uhhuh .
so do you still think that reasoning is good ?
do you still think that's good thinking or have you changed your mind now ?
well I think that you /.
who do you think it's for ?
should show /.
uhhuh .
it to me if it's for Adam .
if it's for Adam then why not show it to you right ?
no see if it is for Adam then you do .
then I do show it to you ?
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
well I'm not going to show it to you so what does that mean ?
it's for me .
you think now it's for you .
mhm .
are you sure of that ?
well if you're hiding it from me it's mine .
well if you're not ...
maybe I'm just hiding it from Adam .
well who ?
well don't worry !
he's not coming over to our house !
we're going over to his .
so you think that's a pretty good okay .
so how do you feel about it ?
who's it for at this point ?
who would you guess ?
who would you guess if you hadta guess ?
is it for Ross or for Adam .
I don't know .
you're not sure now .
right .
now daddy keeps on telling you it's for Adam right ?
mhm .
so you can't make up your mind can you ?
right .
well it's tough isn't it .
yeah and I wanna kill .
what ?
tell .
no way .
well then /.
daddy's are not supposed to tell .
then it should be mine .
daddy's /.
then it's will be mine .
how do you know that ?
if you will hide it from me it's mine because you know that he's not coming over right now .
mhm .
so won't be .
you know something Ross ?
what ?
you're right .
so it's mine ?
you're right .
it's for you .
yay !
yes .
it is .
it's for you .
you guessed it .
because if I hide it there's no way that I would hide something that is for Adam if it's for Adam why should I hide it right ?
right .
the only reason I should hide it is because I don't want you little kids to see it .
yeah .
you got it right .
you got the right answer .
shwhew !
dad .
yes son .
do you know what Trono is about ?
what ?
do you know what Tron is about ?
Trono ?
yeah .
yeah I know the whole story .
you're not going to tell it .

mhm .
to the Jedi .
they call it revenge of the Jedi .
revenge of the Jedi .
and /.
is going to be the next /.
next /.
no !
is that the next ...
which is revenge of the Jedi is the whole trilogy ?
that's why well that's what the name that they started off with .
well the first name was Star_Wars .
yeah .
the book's first movie would stop .
uhuh second movie ...
was empire strikes back .
mhm .
third movie ...
revenge of the Jedi .
no return of the Jedi .
no revenge of the Jedi could be called return of the Jedi instead .
why do we call it that instead ?
aren't we making a mistake ?
no .
they started off with that .
like a mistake ...
but then they decided that /.
they changed their mind huh ?
yeah .
do all of the movies .
oh I see .
eat your meal .
so they call all of the movies for short ...
Marky ...

well do you ?
do I buy their things ?
no , I wont buy them because I think they're playing dirty tricks .

mhm .
I don't think we agree .
you don't think they're doing it so good ?

who made this mess ?
both of us .

mhm .
You_can't_do_that_on_television .
mhm , how about moose ?

.
I have a clear example of a malapropism , when he said "/.
I like this shirt I mean .
and what was happening was that he was pulling clothes from pajama drawer , had already put on a pair of sleep shorts and finds the matching top to go with shorts .
he said "/.
burping at the table too .
burping quiet at the table too .
I see .
come here honey .
is it good to burp at the table ?
.
no it isn't !
yeah .
it's not polite Mark .
yeah .
how do they make life_savers ?
well at first the handle /.
mhm .
they used tin , and they used the thing that mom told me /.
mhm .
you can see through it , it's kind of like plastic and /.
mhm .
well what I was thinking it did , is there's a little spring inside of it and there's a shield around /.
mhm .
too and there's food colors inside and when you press a button it makes the spring punch up the green food color .
hm .
help .
you're exactly right .
I really think that's what happens .
you know that program we saw on tv on channel thirteen where everybody was naked ?
what was that Ross ?
well you know it wasn't very colorful , just like Dukes_of_Hazzards isn't very colorful .
just believe me .
it wasn't very colorful .
daddy you know Knight_Rider was on a very long time and before you thought it was murder .
huhuh .
yeah , you thought it was murder .
you thought it was people killing each_other .
you mean the program and I wouldn't let you watch Knight_Rider ?
yeah , when we were four or something like that .
I thought it was too violent .
yeah .
oh .
but it wasn't really .
wasn't that A_Team ?
no .
oh .
that was Knight_Rider don't you remember ?
oh maybe you're right .
maybe you're right .
a long time back before we even got into it ?
okay , but they don't really murder people on it now , do they ?
right .
you just didn't even know .
no I didn't know .
no , I was afraid though .
I was afraid it might be a_lot_of murder on that .
mhm .
there are some of those programs that have a_lot_of murder , right ?
mhm .
oh , what do you mean it's been on a long time ?
well because a long time you wouldn't let us see it and it was on for a very long time .
it had been on for a long time you mean .
yeah .
and I hadn't let you see it ?
is that right ?
yeah .
and you missed all the first parts of Knight_Rider ?
mhm .
and then when they told me it wasn't murderer then I told you .
and then we let you see it right ?
mhm .
and now do you think it's one of the best programs on tv ?
best ?
yeah ?
it's one of I don't like it , I love it .

they're all the same price .
they're all the same price .
well then when I get there I want Sprite .

what if I told you /.
that's for you .
what if I said that Sprite is cheaper than Coka_Cola ?
I would go with Sprite .

he got confused about heads and tails from the coin and started to apply the notion of heads and tails to his eggs where eggs only have tails , they don't actually don't have heads .

yesterday Mark was walking around with a carrot going "/.

Mark thought that was so neat he kept it up and he kept on walking around going "/.
nah , what's up doc .
and everytime he did it to Ross Ross looked a little less interested .
about the tenth time he walked around to Ross and said "/.
nah , what's up doc .
Ross turned and did the same carrot munching move and said "/.
nah , shut up doc .
the thing of it was that the timing was absolutely perfect .
after that Ross went around saying "/.
nah shut up doc .
when he realized how clever it was then he started over doing it on that one too .
I was taking issue with someone on television who had said it is her .

it wasn't very polite to tell big bird that his nest was all full of sticks .

maybe he shouldn't have gotten in .
yeah I wouldn't have even asked .

oh ‚Ä° good .
.

but it wouldn't have come off in real life if it had happened in real life .
look .
.
hey Mark ‚Ä° that's ...
oo .
that's very dangerous .
Mark ‚Ä° you could really slip and fall on your noggin .
what's a noggin ?
your noggin is your head .
.
there's one more thing you should be careful of .
what's that ‚Äû Mark ?
your jaw .
yes ‚Ä° that's true .
because your teeth might fall off .
oh ‚Ä° that's true .
your pretty teeth .
.
will fall out .
uhhuh .
what if it did ?
probably it would hurt .
.
I'm guessing you're //.

Meredith once she was going on her teeth falling out .

.
okay ‚Ä° Mark .
finished ?
yeah ‚Ä° I'm finished .
could I please be excused ‚Äû please ?
yes ‚Ä° you may please be excused .
and I said two pleases for mamma .
that's good ‚Äû dear .
that's because this is your real mamma and not that nasty woman with a mask .
know that .
your real mamma does not have a mask .
and she loves you .
she doesn't break your neck either .
your real mommy is a lovely woman .
just does not run momma's .
you gotta watch out for those .
I know .
.
I'm not sure whether I recorded this or not from yesterday .
but I think I should .
I was telling Ross yesterday that ...
wait a second /.
I'm having a_little trouble with this recording level .
I think I'll turn it down .
hold on .
hi .
okay ‚Ä° I'm gonna record down at a lower level .
record at a lower /.
oh ‚Ä° there we go .
okay .
yesterday I was telling Ross that I caught him lying .
now ‚Ä° I'm trying to remember what the lie was that I caught him doing .
oh ‚Ä° yes .
he said "/.
I asked him how many cookies he had .
and he said he had had two .
and he was on his third .
and I said "/.
you mean three .
you're on your third now ‚Äû right ?
and he said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° I was just checking to see if you knew .
or something he said .
and I said "/.
Ross ‚Ä° don't lie to me .
you_know parents know an awful lot .
and they can catch their little children when they lie .
and I really don't like it when you lie .
and he said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° I /.
so ‚Ä° before this I said "/.
you mean three you've had ?
yes ‚Ä° yes ‚Ä° I've had three .
he said ".
he corrected himself to say "/.
yes ‚Ä° I've had three .
so_that he cleaned up his lie a little bit .
and then I went through the spin of parents can tell if children have lies .
and he said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° I know parents can find lies .
that's why I changed and told the truth .
and I said "/.
you know Ross it's not worth it to lie because parents know a_lot_of things so they can find out when they make lies .
and you_know and so Ross interpreted this not as a thing that he should watch out for or worry about because parents are always going to find out his lies but as a statement about parental skills being more than children's skills .
and he said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° well ‚Ä° you can't learn how to break dance .
.
of_course because it's true .
it is parental skills .
right ‚Ä° it is parental skills .
and he wanted to point out that "/.
okay ‚Ä° so ‚Ä° you're so great .
you can tell about lies .
but I can breakdance .
well ‚Ä° what would be the other way of him proving it ?
oh ‚Ä° well ‚Ä° I'll watch /.
you have a good point .
I'll try not to /.
the other was point would "/.
I'll try not to lie because it is /.
you're right .
it is a good idea in life not to get caught .
and it's you_know it was to take it as an admonition rather than as a challenge .
he took it as a challenge to his ability .
.
he may have taken it as an admonition too .
right .
but then he had a real gleam in his eye .
well ‚Ä° I can /.
and he thought he was so cute showing that something that he could do .
but anyway //.
you hadn't gotten on top of him .
he certainly /.
I hadn't gotten on top of him .
that was the thing .
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .
maintain .
I think would be a full persona .
uhhuh .
he did pretty well .
I_mean he didn't quite make it through because he missed the point .
tell them about his little conversation with Mark and Ross's interaction with us .
oh ‚Ä° Ross .
on the side of well this conversation about Mark telling us about his dream witch .
talking about a witch or ...
Ross said ...
he didn't say anything ‚Äû did he ?
he didn't say anything .
he had a gleam in his eye .
but his //.
and laughing along with the two of us .
he said "/.
yeah .
no ‚Ä° he did say one thing .
he said something about "/.
she wasn't your real mom ‚Äû was she ?
real mom wouldn't act like that ‚Äû would she ?
haw haw haw .
ha ha ha .
in other words mommy //.
he sort_of understood that dreams do reflect a little bit of reality .
and that isn't it cute that Mark isn't in on that yet ?
yeah ‚Ä° well ‚Ä° you and I were kind_of smiling at each_other .
and he picked up on that .
right ‚Ä° right ‚Ä° we were smiling .
and he picked up on that .
and in the same tenor he actually sort_of verbalized a little bit about it with //.
he was in the know .
yeah ‚Ä° he was //.
with his parents .
with his parents about little baby brother .
.
isn't it cute ?
he does a_lot_of that .
.
Marky came up the stairs and said "/.
I'm homesick .
and Ross said "/.
you are at home .
and he said "/.
I'm homesick not seasick .
because I'm at home and because_of my swishing around head .
I guess he had probably came up the stairs too fast and feeling dizzy .
who knows what he was doing .
.
and oh at last I get to go to the bathroom .
.
Mark drew a maze .
and he showed me a star at the top of the page .
and he said "/.
look !
you see that I put the star there .
and I said why .
and he said "/.
because I wanted to remind of yourself that it was a starting .
get it ?
star^ting ?
so ‚Ä° anyway ‚Ä° on the maze he had drawn a start at a starting point .
.
Ross is watching Mark put jam on a big Kaiser roll , big hamburger roll .
and Ross said "/.
Mark ‚Ä° I thin^k you think that's an oversized roll .
no ‚Ä° muffin .
muffin .
and Mark said "/.
I don't .
it's just a little bit big .
wow Ross //.
the nurse called from school on the phone .
and she that one of my sons wanted to talk to me .
so ‚Ä° it was Mark on the phone .
and he got on the phone .
and he said "/.
Mom ‚Ä° my head feels hard .
and then he said it felt hot .
but the nurse said it didn't feel hot .
and anyway the nurse came back on the phone and said "/.
no ‚Ä° Mark doesn't have a fever .
and he doesn't have a hot head .
and I said "/.
well ‚Ä° maybe his head feels hard , inside hard .
and she said "/.
well ‚Ä° no ‚Ä° he's feeling the outside of it .
and he says it feels hard on one side .
.
Mark well he had the nurse call .
and she called me today .
do you wanna play what I'm playing ?
and he said "/.
because I wasn't feeling good .
I had a hard head .
and it was warm .
he turns into //.
.
Mark went to the cat drawer and pulled out some catnip .
and he said "/.
well ‚Ä° this will work him up .
it's interesting that he used that word because we don't generally use it for the cat or anyone .
except for we do say it to Ross when we say "/.
watch out .
you're gonna get Mark all worked up .
but we don't use that word any other time .
.
Mark brought up this strange subject of "/.
Mom do people ever think that little kids ...
do people ever think that other people are robbers who aren't robbers ?
and I hadta talk that one through and see if he really meant what he said he was meaning or something or another .
and we got finished with that topic .
and he said "/.
oh ‚Ä° I said how little kids even five year olds in bad neighborhoods were robbers .
stop it Ross .
.
and ...
so ‚Ä° then he said "/.
well ‚Ä° where's my milk .
and I went out to get him his glass of milk .
and he ...
when I came back I noticed that the cushion from my chair was gone .
and he had stolen it and put it on another chair .
that's not called stealing .
I call that stealing .
and I think you set me up .
.
.
is that why you asked for milk ?
no .
you didn't ask for milk to get me out_of the room so you could steal my cushion ?
.
no ?
well ‚Ä° what made you think of asking for milk ?
because I ...
huh ?
oo^ps I was just hungry for more .
you were just hungery for milk .
well ‚Ä° what made you think of stealing my cushion ?
that's not steal^ing .
it's not stealing ?
no .
what is it ?
just putting it on my chair .
well ‚Ä° you didn't put it on your chair .
so ‚Ä° were you playing a trick ?
yeah .
what made you think of playing that trick ?
I like tricks .
I bet you do .
.
Mark's gonna tell me a story .
and he took me all the way down because he wanted to show me where the tape recorder is .
it is in the den .
he said "/.

once in a galaxy far far far far far far far far far away ...
uhhuh .
there once was a pilot and a copilot /.
uhuh .
named Han Solo and and Chewbacca .
yeah .
there we were they were out .
far far far far far far far far ...
trying to see who hadta take a pilot .
arr .

far far far far far far far far ...
Mark .
once in a bar there some gangsters pushed Han around but Han just blasted them .
mhm .
they were dead .
yeah that was violent .
I know .
who was dead ?
the guys who bugged the the monsters who bugged Han and Chewy .
do you know who those guys worked for ?
Jabba .
mhm .
and once the two the a young lad named Luke Skywalker came into the bar .
okay .
well he came in a Sand^speeder .
mhm .
and Ben Kenobi the old desert ...
I mean ...
the old desert hermit .
the old desert hermit came with him .
he gave him a light saber and taught him half of the force .
mhm .
but they came with two Droids too .
and they hadta leave them out_of the bar because they could have been damaged .
mhm .
and there were no Droids allowed in the bar .
that's right .
in what bar ?
in the cantina .
yeah .
creature cantina /.
and when they came into this little place with a table and Han with Chewy were there .
mhm .
and they asked if they could go to Alderon in their ship .
mhm .
and Han and Chewbacca said "/.
sure but it'll cost you plenty !
zzz .
sure cost you plenty !
yeah so what happened ?
they went but by accident when they flew off stormtroopers knocked out their engine and they couldn't steer it .
right .
I'm changing a little bit .
yeah that's true .
and they /.
did they make the jump in hyperspace ?
they hadta put on a forcefield so if they crashed they would like bounce away .
mhm .
mhm .
and when they soon came near Alderon they couldn't believe what they saw !
Alderon was destroyed !
been blasted to pieces .
there was an asteroid where it was blasted .
mhm .
that's right .
then near it was the Death_Star .
they were being sucked in .
mhm .
right .
then when they were in , the Lord Darth and his captive Empire checked the the ship .
mhm .
but there was no passengers .
they were hiding in the compartments .
special compartment yeah ?
yeah .
and when one stormtrooper came Chewbacca opened his lid and threw them down and stuffed his fist in his mouth .
mhm .
and went arr and Chewy knocked him out .
and he closed his lid .
and he and he gave the suit to Luke .
mhm .
and Han was in there too .
right .
and so Chewby open his lid again and got another stormtrooper and knocked him out .
and closed the lid and gave the thing to Han .
and then and then Ben Kenobi got out the hatch /.
mhm .
mhm .
and he was with the switch with Invisopower and he turned on Invisopower so he could get through .
mhm .
and he tried to turn tried to like free Leia .
mhm .
by accident she was caught with Darth Vader .
yes .
and meanwhile Luke and Han they got some chains like wristbands ...
mhm .
mhm .
and put them on Chewy .
and they pretended that they were taking a prisoner down to see Darth Vader .
right .
and by accident or well they were trapped .
in a part of the Death_Star yeah .
yeah .
and stormtroopers kept shooting across .
but they got Leia free didn't they ?
no not yet .
I'm not making it not yet .
oh yeah right .
I'm making it not yet I mean .
you're getting there .
and then ?
but then when they shot they shot Chewbacca .
he was dead .
no !
I'm making it up .
oh okay .
oh poor Chewy .
and they hadta heal his skin if he was left stay so well Luke had a an firstaid kit from home .
mhm .
and he had some bandaid and they taped up his skin .
pulled out the bullet .
no it was an arrow .
it was an arrow uhhuh .
shooting out_of the gun .
a laser arrow .
yeah .
yeah uhhuh .
and well then they went on and by accident they were caught between Darth Vader and his group .
mhm .
and they found a hatch and when they ran they slipped into it .
they went like nyeer and they dropped into where Leia was .
mhm .
so then they got her free and when the stormtroopers were blasting at them they had Luke shot a door through the wall and they swang into a garbage dump !
hm .
when the garbage dump kept closing Luke was pulled under by a worm !
hm jeez .
he was almost killed .
okay let's take a break now okay ?
no I'm still suppose to go .
you wanna get to the end ?
mhm .
okay .
and when they shot at that worm they hadta get the walls from closing .
mhm .
so they found this big metal bar but it crushed the bar .
mhm .
so they had to contact R_two_D_two and C_three_P_O and they freed them .
how did they do it ?
well first they touched B_one and that stopped the walls from closing and sucked the worm under .
mhm .
no three-d sucked the worm under .
mhm .
so and then R_two_D_two and C_three_P_O threw down a rope and tied it to someplace and they climbed up .
mhm .
and then they got to the Falcon .
and meanwhile Darth Vader and Ben Kenobi were fighting .
mhm .
and Darth flang up his light saber and so did Ben .
and then by well Ben damaged I mean Vader .
mhm .
and then Vader threw his light saber into his clothes .
mhm .
hm .
and he and then there was nothing when he shattered down but his clothes .
yeah right .
and they were still running to the ship and when they got out they hadta fight these things ?
mhm .
ships .
Luke got four hundred and Han got nine thousand .
mhm .
so they they broke the time barrier .
right .
if they were gonna get out_of there .
okay .
you wanna take a break now ?
because there's a lot more Ross .
when they got down to where the rest of the base was they hadta plan their attack against the Empire .
uhhuh .
and Luke volunteered for an X_wing when they were fighting against the Empire .
Luke blasted nine thousand hundred .
mhm .
and the other guys were blown up .
mhm .
and then it was between Darth Vader and Luke .
and Luke let go .
mhm .
and one sarge he said "/.
what's happening to you ?
Luke I'm fine .
and Han flew down and Darth blasted at him .
then Han flew down and he put on his shield .
so and Han got out_of there .
mhm .
so Luke could fire his dynamite so they went bzoom and blasted Darth Vader's ship .
mhm .
he had a parachute of course .
mhm .
and then when they got back /.
mhm .
they received the medals .

well why do you think time flies Ross ?

he went no by the mountain .
the mountain tricked you .
first you thought it was dark and then you turned around and suddenly saw it was light .
the mountain got in your way .
so you couldn't see the sunset .
like it is doing now .
uhhuh .

Ross says "/.

I don't like soup .
and he said "/.

well actually you said "/.

I don't know yet .
well I just can .
you ate soup in my dream .
you don't know yet , but you just did ?
he really ate soup in my dream .
he just doesn't know .
that's right .
you just don't know Ross .
oh yeah ?
yeah .
I do not eat soup !
yes .
no .
because the real Rossy wasn't in my dream .
the real Rossy wasn't in his dream Ross .
it was just the dream Ross right ?
well then maybe you got Tiffany's Ross .
Tiffany's Ross ?
yeah .
who's Tiffany's Ross ?
it's Tiffany's boyfriend .
oh really ?
mhm .
does Tiffany have a boyfriend ?
yeah .

she's in my class .
oh yeah ?

and her boyfriend is called ...
Ross ...
Ross Alexander ?
hmhm no .
Ross Alexander MacWhinney ?
hmhm .
hm ?
Ross Alexander MacWhinney ?
are you her boyfriend ?
hmhm .
are you sure you're not her boyfriend ?
hmhm .
and you know what ?
.
and he's /.

hey Dad you know I had an idea ?
why not ?
know what Ross ?
well these Ewoks were playing .
they good and bad Ewoks by accident someone shot the catapult .
it almost hit a Ewok named ...
Gargamel ?
Skyscraper .
uhhuh .
he was so little so they called him Skyscraper .
I see .
isn't that funny ?
how many kids wanna eat breakfast with Daddy ?
well it's not done yet .
but then they were ...
I wanna sleep .
they were all ...
I wanna sleep .
then they were finding and ...
mhm .
he brought a picture to me and I said "/.
what is that ?
and he said "/.
I'll draw it .
I'll show you what it is .
and he went back and he wrote mhiabbi .
and I said "/.
oh it's , , mhiabbi .
and he said "/.
yeah whatever .
and he took it to Mary and he said look Mom it's a mobby .
, I mean mhiabbi .
what's interesting about this is that a little bit earlier , he was saying what's s e r b y s and i said it's a serbys and what's g o n k u r and this is a gonkur and he kept on spelling random letter combinations and I hadta pronounce them .
a_lot_of them were unpronounceable .
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just throw letters together and some how they'll make a word .
this is very much like when he was a little baby he useta sort of make up words even though they didn't really mean anything sort of to describe some unspecifiable thing .
now he is writing them out .
Mary says that she useta do that when she was a kid .
now I certainly never remember doing any thing like that .
she also remembers taking pictures to people and asking them what they were .
again I'd never do I mean any where near like that .
I can never did anything in fact that I can remember that was very fantasy oriented at all .
well let's see we were , .
.
Ross is having some orange juice and I took a little sip from glass before /.
I want some good juice .
I gave it to him and Ross complains , said Daddy took some of mine or something like that he said .
and I said I'm just testing .
and he said you're not testing .
what'd you say ?
I already had a glass ?
which means that /.
.
you knew it was okay because /.
I already had some and I liked it .
I already had some and I liked it , yeah .
you'd already poured me a glass and you knew it was okay at that point .
and I knew it was okay .
so why are you checking for the consistency at a later point .
it couldn't have changed by now .
I asked Ross could you be a little nicer and he said I hate being nice .
am I being nice ?
am I being nice ?
yeah you're being nice .
and then when were you so nice ?
and he said I hadta be that way all the way home yesterday .
hadta be that way all the way home yesterday .
in the car coming home from Washington DC .
mhm .
that's true .
you were good yesterday .
mhm .
then why can't I be bad today ?
zzz .
well why do I hafta make breakfast and bring you things ?
why do I hafta be that good mother ?
when I'd really just like to sit here and stuff my face .
just make coffee for me .
just make the rolls for me .
just serve myself forget you .
yeah .
yeah .
stop doing ...
I hafta say would you like some tea honey ?
mhm .
and then if you say yes I hafta go out there and make it instead of drinking my coffee .
why do I hafta be nice like that huh ?
Ross come back .
oh he's gonna give you a kiss .
oh he's gonna ...
maybe he's come and do something nice .
zzz .
zzz .
he came around and got his own honey instead of asking someone for it .
because he knew that if he would be told that he was asking and demanding for too many things , right ?
Ross use your spoon when you do that okay ?
I was .
mhm .
and I'm going to .
how come you didn't let him pour it ?
what ?
you don't want him 0to pour it ?
no it's too much .
oops .

twirl your spoon .
mm .
twirl it around .
good !
now go !
hey good .
Marky what would you like ?
and then you can lick your spoon .
.
but don't use it again .
I know .
Marky just did a picture and he said I can't wait all day .
he came up to me , I can't wait all day !
what he meant was that he wanted me too ...
I assume that what he was me to put a name on it and have me date it so it was /.
or look at it .
look at it or something , yeah .
pay some attention to it .
and , so I put a name on it , date it and I said okay go put it over on Ross's desk and he said I'll put it in pile .
in other words he didn't say the pile put it in a pile .
drop the a .

or a seven .
maybe you're as smart as they are .
maybe they're just more careful .
but no .
they're not too smart .

the teacher knows ten times more than all the kids do .

I saw them play with buses .

Ross said "/.

but I've never noticed before .
Mary told him to do something .
he said "/.
I couldn't with a blanket on my face .
and what this of_course has is a structure which is and ellipsis and a relative clause .
hey ‚Ä° it quit .
it quit .
no ‚Ä° it didn't .
oh .
a relative clause that has sort_of /.
yeah the structure is "/.
I couldn't do it given that I had a blanket on my face .
in other words .
it had structure .
that's the first time I've noticed the structure .
although ‚Ä° it may have been around before .
you've left pause in there .
Dad .
okay .
well ‚Ä° I undid pause .
Dad .
okay ‚Ä° Marky //.
this one and this one and this one and this one this one and this one and this one are done .
okay ‚Ä° just a minute Mark .
they're not .
Mark's sponging off all of the tiles .
and he said "/.
all the ones by themselves are clean .
is that right Marky ?
yeah .
and that means all the ones that are that have been placed in little piles all by themselves are clean .
Mark's he's cleaning up all the tiles .
and you can just leave it there .
we'll talk some more .
okay .
okay ?
okay ‚Ä° now ‚Ä° what //?
these are clean .

this one and that one and this one and that one .
this one and that one and this one and that one .
this one and that one and this one and that one .
this one and that one and this one and that one .
they're all clean ?
yeah .
mkay .

big red pot .

yeah .
what are these things we're putting up on the wall Mark ?

ceramic tile adhesive .
what ?
oh ‚Ä° never_mind .
no ‚Ä° what are the names of these things that we're putting on the wall .
are they blocks or what are they ?
what are they Mark ?
ceramics .
ceramics ?
yeah .
what does a tile look like ?
you ever seen a tile ?
what does a tile look like ?
it's that .
what's a tile ?
that .
is that a tile ?
yeah .
yeah ‚Ä° so ‚Ä° you know what a tile is ‚Äû don't you ?
.
more .
uhhuh .
whoopsie .
and that gookie gloppie white stuff is the adhesive for the ceramic tile .
that's right .
oh ‚Ä° yeah .
and Daddy's making a gloopy gloppy mess with that gloopy gloppy glue .
is it hot ?
no .
no .
no ‚Ä° it's not burning hot .
it's not hot at all .
gloop .
Daddy's glooping it all over .
.
where's the clean sponge ?
I don't know .
help me put tiles on real quick .
Marky ‚Ä° Daddy could use that clean sponge .
yeah .
I could use that .
yeah .
yep .
I could use that clean sponge .
.
it's starting to get into my eyes .
my eyes are starting to get it .
.
burning ?
yeah .
.
I need the clean sponge .
this'll be enough for now .
I need the clean sponge .
.
.
maybe Mark shouldn't be in here .
why ?
might be burning into his /.
his eyes might get too burny from it .
oh .
.
.
can you open the door Mark ?
mhm .
I'll do it .
you or I ?
I'll do it .
oh .
.
Dad ‚Ä° that is cold .
yeah ‚Ä° but it's better than having my eyes burn out .
oh .
do you want me to turn it off ?
that really cools the air through here though .
oh ‚Ä° yeah .
do you want me to turn it off ?
what do you mean off ?
oh ‚Ä° yeah ‚Ä° you can turn the tape recorder off .
.
today is May eighth .
May eighth .
and Mary's gonna tell how Ross rescued her .
okay .
well ‚Ä° Brian came in the door .
mhm .
and was upset because the grout wasn't finished .
hm .
and Ross told Brian not to /.
what'd he say ?
not to be hard on me ?
yeah ‚Ä° something like that .
basically that .
I mean "/.
don't be so hard on mother .
she's had a rough day .
I said "/.
why ?
and Brian questioned him .
wasn't gonna let him slide with an easy explanation .
yeah .
anyway ‚Ä° so ‚Ä° Brian said "/.
why ?
and I think Ross said "/.
don't ask .
didn't he ?
yeah .
or "/.
she just did .
she had a rough day .
she had a hard day .
right .
but anyway the whole idea was that Ross really ...
all by himself .
it was not a put up job .
right .
he defended me .
defended hm .
well ‚Ä° he said that you had had a ...
I asked him "/.
what was so hard ?
what was so hard about mom's day ?
yeah ‚Ä° and she said "/.
I asked what was so hard .
and he said "/.
well ‚Ä° she hadta spend all her time with us .
and we kept her very busy .
which is probably true .
is that true Mary ?
had you taken them to get doughnuts or something ?
yeah .
no ‚Ä° I hadn't taken them anywhere .
.
anyway he ...
yeah .
but they see you spend a_lot_of time messing with the boys .
and that's why she hadn't had time to do the grouting .
that's probably true .
I'd say it's not the first time .
but it's certainly the clearest time Ross has ever come to someone's defense ‚Äû right ?
yeah , yeah .
in totally instigated by himself .
and did it very convincingly .
yeah ‚Ä° and we think that he's been getting practice at school with a kid who's been picked on by everyone else .
and Ross has befriended this particular child .
we know that from his teacher that Ross has been very supportive of a new kid at school in class who's been having troubles .
like he's been running away from the playground and stuff .
and Ross has befriended this kid .
and I guess he's been explaining his actions to the other kids .
and telling the other kids to not treat him so rough .
because the other kids have been treating the new kid making fun of him .
right .
so ‚Ä° we I guess we suspect that Ross has been getting practice and is getting really good at defending the underdog .
.
Mark was responding to a story .
I was reading a story about a little boy who said mean things to another boy .
and he said "/.
you know what ?
I'd really like to kick him .
I mean you know I /.
I kind_of frowned .
and he said "/.
you know I'm glad he's not in real life .
and I said "/.
uhhuh .
and he said "/.
you know what ?
I really ...
you_know I had fun at Aaron's house .
I don't know what that meant .
I really don't .
but in any case that's the way Mark's mind works .
.
Mark to put on his socks .
and he says "/.
he said "/.
I'm putting on them .
he says that very typical error .
and I'm surprised to see he's still making them .
Marky you're a little baby .
you wanna go pee in the toilet ?
or you wanna go pee in your bed ?
and he said "/.
oh ‚Ä° that's funny Daddy .
and he said "/.
I'm glad I didn't go poop ...
I'm glad I didn't go poop like when I was a little baby and I went poop on our rug .
and I said "/.
do you remember that Mark ?
and he said "/.
oh ‚Ä° yeah ‚Ä° I remember that .
I said "/.
why'd you do it Mark ?
and he said "/.
I don't know why .
I was just a little bad boy .
.
and he laughed .
no .
and then it was very clear that he didn't remember this .
I was just /.
I was just /.
I was just a little bit too dumb .
this is something he did when he was two .
yeah ‚Ä° and do you have any reason why you did it ?
I don't know .
maybe it was just poop in .
do you know how old you were ?
do you know how old you were ?
two .
you just turned two .
maybe not even two about one and a half .
you were pretty young .
you really remember it ‚Äû huh ?
it's true we did have a rug then .
yeah .
so ...
but it was blue .
except it was a little bit darker .
yeah .
no ‚Ä° it wasn't blue .
Mark it was brown .
now ‚Ä° let's go to bed .
yeah ‚Ä° it was .
Mark said "/.
if you stood up in the north in one place for five years you'd die .
I said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° from the freezing cold .
and I said "/.
how'd you like to live up in the frozen arctic ?
he said "/.
no way .
Ross said "/.
how do the Eskimos do it ?
.
how do the Eskimos do it ?
and I said "/.
they're tough .
and they wear a_lot_of clothes .
and I said "/.
how'd you like to live in the burning hot desert ?
and they said "/.
no way .
and Ross said "/.
I think we'll stay right here .
let's stay right here in Pittsburgh .
right here .
and I said "/.
in Pittsburgh .
and he said "/.
yeah .
and Marky said "/.
except that then we would get involved in the army .
so ‚Ä° it was just if you were in the desert you wouldn't get involved in the army ‚Äû right Mark ?
no ‚Ä° if you were here you wouldn't get involved in the army .
is that what you meant Mark ?
and you wouldn't get involved in drunks .
in drunks ?
and what do you call them ?
yeah .
drugs .
yeah ‚Ä° drugs .
mkay .
is that true ?
like cigarettes and and all .
mhm .
and you won't get involved in guns or or ...
hey ‚Ä° .
gotta see if this testing is right .
looks like the battery's not ...
just a baby .
it's not up .

it looks like the battery's running out .
.
caw .
yeah ‚Ä° battery .
low battery .
like what ?
low battery nya .
low battery nya .
low battery nya .
low battery nya .
and Mark said "/.
do all /.
he said "/.
do all countries have armies ?
do all countries hafta have armies ?
no ‚Ä° not the little ones .
they don't have armies .
then we can take them over .
well ‚Ä° we're very careful .
some countries we're very careful with .
but you're right .
the reason that they have armies is because people think that you can take them over .
take them over ?
and in the old days the armies made some sense .
but now people have nuclear bombs .
.
wait a second .
in the old //.
our country is a free country .
mhm .
why can't we ask everybody else to become a part of it and be free ?
and then that would be the end of the problems ‚Äû right ?
yeah .
I know .
we've thought about that .
but they don't think that we mean business .
they think we're just trying to trick them .
yeah ‚Ä° they do .
they think we're just trying to trick them .
you_know our country's pretty good .
but you_know we dropped a nuclear bomb on some people once .
we did ?
we did .
we dropped it on the Japanese .
they're pretty an enemy right now I guess .
no ‚Ä° no ‚Ä° they forgave us .
but it wasn't a very nice thing to do ‚Äû was it ?
you mean one of this family did it ?
if I was allowed to have the last of .
no ‚Ä° one of our country did it .
they had a war .
if there was a tie .
and there was one remote other vote for the other guy .
not //.
Mondale ?
yeah ‚Ä° Mondale .
oh ‚Ä° it's too late for that Ross .
Reagan's back in .
he hasn't brought any peace yet .
but we're waiting .
we hope that someday something will happen .
yeah ‚Ä° and we've got four years office .
yeah ‚Ä° well ‚Ä° we'll see what happens .
he //.
he's wrecking .
okay ‚Ä° now ‚Ä° you guys go to sleep ‚Äû okay ?

the doctors fixed him up .
.
Mark ‚Ä° he wasn't even punching you .
well ‚Ä° he was going like that .

he was doing real little ones .
scoot over Ross .
anyway ‚Ä° time for both of you to go to bed now .
good_night boys .
.
.
let's see .
I just needta record this .
oh ‚Ä° okay ‚Ä° I'm having trouble with the volume reception .
but anyway Mark said "/.
I gave them /.
Mark had a penny .
he said "/.

and I'll see how much money I have once I put this in .
here's all the money I have of all money is just a penny .
which is that first use of once in that sense .
oh ‚Ä° you mean of American money ?

hm ?
would you just do it ?
if I said "/.
hey ‚Ä° you gotta go kill somebody .
and you think it's wrong .
would you just go and do it ?
hmhm .
do you think it's right to kill people ?
hmhm .
then ‚Ä° why wouldn't you just go do it ?
hmhm .
I mean I'd tell you to do it .
is that a choice ?
do you have a choice ?
hmhm .
you have a choice to do it if I tell you to do it ?
anyway ‚Ä° when we said //.
.
a little bit earlier we were talking about this .
and Ross //.
that hat's .
yeah .
in the army with nine lives you'll need them .
May eleventh .
I wish I was a cat and cats really did have nine lives .

mhm .
oh .

he reconstructed that one .
it's a good thing cats have nine lives .
nine lives .
in any kind of army they will need them .
mhm .
yeah .
and I mean I guess it's a good thing cats have nine lives .
and with nine lives I'll need them .
that was .
Ross ‚Ä° what if you could go to the army and you would never get killed .

.
I would just //.

yeah ‚Ä° that's what you do in life because there's no teams or nothing .
how'd you like to just kill somebody .
.

.
I wouldn't .
if I was a ...
I wouldn't kill any person .
oh .
no reason to kill people ‚Äû right ?
yeah .
even if they try and kill you .
if they try to kill you you know the best thing to do ?
what ?
get away .
or if you're at the house call the phone number .
right .
//.
call the police .
mhm .
you know what people think of the creatures machinery now ?
hm ?
I think they're getting a headstart .
yeah ‚Ä° because you know those new refrigerators and the doors of the garage doors that beep whenever you didn't close them ?
mhm .

and if you don't close them they automatically close themselves .
yeah ?
they're getting pretty tricky now ‚Äû huh ?

Mark and Ross have been interested in dinosaurs the last couple days .
and last night Mark was saying something about how he knew more about dinosaurs than I did .
and Mark said "/.
oh ‚Ä° I know all about dinosaurs too .
and then we argued about what dinosaur .
and I said it was .
and here this morning Mary Mark .
Mark was up first so he was on the staircase first and talking first .
he said "/.
Mom ‚Ä° is there such thing as a ..?
what was the first one ?
well ‚Ä° it wasn't that .
dinosaur .
.
is there such thing as a Ankylosaurus ?
no .
is there such thing as a Pteranodon ?
anyway ‚Ä° it was obvious that he was rehearsing from last night .
oh ‚Ä° no ‚Ä° that's not all .
he must have been getting them somewhere else .
.
because Pteranodon was just not mentioned last night .
.
oh ‚Ä° really ?
yeah .
I thought that was .
.
.
Mommy .
.
oh ‚Ä° yeah ?
Dad ‚Ä° I know what to do .
.
.
Marky said "/.

we'll have that much money again .
we'll get one of these guys .
right ?
yeah .
I said "/.
no ‚Ä° first he said "/.
if you had two of enough money you'd buy another one and get two of these .
and I said "/.
we'll never have that much money .
we're not that rich .
he said "/.
no ‚Ä° but if we had that much money then we'd buy //.

we got one guy .
not two guy .

well ‚Ä° if we had that much money two more times or three more times or four more times .
yeah yeah .
if it was one more time then there would be two guys .
what if we had //?
if it was two more times it would be three guys .
mhm .
yeah .
if it was four times it would be four guys .
mhm .
no .
no ‚Ä° it would be ...
five .
five guys .
mhm .
and what if it were six times ?
it'd be seven guys .
seven guys .
yeah ‚Ä° seven /.

okay ‚Ä° go ahead .
Mark and I were sitting at a restaurant .
shall I continue ?
mhm .
and not saying anything .
and Mark said "/.
Mom ‚Ä° what comes from what comes from what comes from what ?
everything hasta come from something .
what if there's no soil ?
then no houses .
can't be any houses to be build unless they're made of glass .
and then I asked "/.
why does a house hafta come after the soil ?
Mark said "/.
the soil /.
no .
the soil .
then come the trees .
then come the houses because they hafta be made of wood .
and then how do you think you would build a house without wood ?
crazy .
and what if you wanna build an attic ?
because attics are made of wood .
and so I asked "/.
what if you wanna make your house of grass or rocks ?
and he said "/.
glass ?
and then finally he said "/.
and I ask again "/.
and he said "/.
you need that stuff to stick them together .
you know that stuff that sticks bricks together .
guess what ?
these people sure do work fast ‚Äû don't they ?
and then that was the end of that conversation .
we were eating .
and he began again .
I noticed every time he began again he would begin with Mom .
Mom ‚Ä° you know what ?
let's see .
wait .
let me try that again .
.
oh .
Mom ‚Ä° you know why I'm hiccuping the other day and today ?
because I'm eating fast .
Mom ‚Ä° when I put up this finger it means it's ...
it means ...
oh .
I'm ...
it means it's time to go to school .
when I put up this finger /.
he held up the other finger .
it's time to go to home .
and then he said "/.
and when I put up this finger ...
using the other finger .
it's time to go to bed .
and when I hold up this finger it's time to wake up .
and I started holding up my fingers .
and it became clear to him that ...
well ‚Ä° then he said "/.
and it means both .
which meant that he had more than one meaning for each finger .
so ‚Ä° he decided that he would only /.
he said "/.
let's only have this finger is for home and this finger is for school .
so ‚Ä° I put up my left ...
wait a minute .
I started putting up my fingers .
and he said "/.
I put /.
oh !
okay .
he didn't say this .
I put up my left hand .
and he looked at it a long time .
and he said "/.
home on yours .
and on mine school .
what happened was he was facing me .
and so I mirror imaged him .
mhm .
and his right finger was for school .
and his left finger was for home .
but I put up my left finger because I was mirror imaging him .
and that's why he said /.
well ‚Ä° anyway ‚Ä° you get the idea .
he actually caught the mirror image .
and I didn't say anything about it .
that's it .
turn it off ?
mhm .
.
okay ‚Ä° I'm asking Mark about what he learned today from the sheriff which came to visit .

what's the difference between precisely and exactly ?
you said there's no difference , right .
right .
do you think there's a little bit of difference between those two words ?
no .
let's think about it .
precisely /.

exact means absolutely perfect .
precisely could just be a little bit off .
it means you tried very hard but you might have missed it just a little /.
of what ?
whatever you it was you were doing .

a how big a toy /.
how big a toy is .
that thing is hot !
you bet it's hot .
why ?
you bet your boody it's hot .
ow .
that's cause they boil these things before they put them out .
you bet your boodies .
this isn't hot .
no the glass gets hotter than the plastic honey .
why ?
because glass conducts heat .
oh .
and plastic is an insulator .
then why is this not so hot ?
because it's not made of glass it's porcelain .
it is too made of glass !
no way .
uhhuh .
it's made of china .
oh .
there's a difference .
china china and glass are both based on sand .
they both come from sand but china has more lime in it .
it makes it white .
oh .
glass is pure sand .
silica .
here .

that's made of metal !
that's not mud .
well this ?
that's metal too .
do you know how they make metal ?
that's the way they looked .
they they turned out to /.
I you mean a ...
look like that color .
I know what you mean .
I know exactly what you mean .
you're talking about pottery .

pottery is different pottery is not the same thing as glass .
you know how they make glass ?

they blow glass .
oh gross .
they get it real hot then they get a tube and they and the glass blows up .

because nothing is falling falling onto it .
Isaac Newton Isaac Newton .
Isaac Newton .
sir Isaac Newton .
yeah .
was a great discoverer of all the things that fall .
I'm not talking about him .
the reason why they fall is because nothing's holding them up so the center of gravity is pulling them down .
and the center of where is the center of gravity in our world ?
right ...

like right in the center of the earth .
very good Ross .
where'd you learn that ?
Mr wizard's world .
wonderful .
okay now why do they come down ?

why do they come down ?
okay .
because this one it holds this piece there so the air catches it up and only only sometimes he loses air up on top /.
my turn .
my turn .
my turn .
right .
.
so he catches more and floats down .
and because_of the center of gravity it pulls her down .
and him with that too .

right .
with the center of gravity .
right .
and that makes him act like a little missile that goes up !
and he jumps up top .

only Markie is worried about it .
we took it back to the place and they were locked and closed and gone .

so we decided that just to keep it all honest we were no longer worried we were just gonna do the honest thing send our money back .
we will do that when we get to Pittsburgh .
we'll send some money back to them to pay for it .
that's just to be honest .
we're not worried that they are out after us with the police or anything .
they are not coming after us .
they don't even know it happened .
there's no motorcycle men coming after us Mark .

because all the hard work that a mother does is try and take care of those little kids .
kitty !
.
kitty , stop that !
it's sposta get markedly cooler .
what did you say ?
it's sposta get markedly cooler .
I bet you thought I said sposta get Mark a pool or something .
no I thought you it's sposta put Marky in the pool .
I can't find a Decepticon to fight with my Autobot .
and /.
and ?
and you have one down down in the basement .
it's and I I can't find another one .
mhm .
so I don't know how we're gonna find a Decepticon to fight with .
well , what does this hafta do with school ?
we're taking them to school .
and Dad , we even if we don't take them outside we can still play with them inside because in the morning , she gives us playtime .
yeah .
until the bell rings .
yeah .
so so that's when we play with Transformers , too .
hm .
you have a basic problem here , Ross .
you're too much .
you are asking for b when you haven't even secured a .
you don't yet have our permission to take Transformer to school .
may I ?
not I won't take the loose pieces .
what if some kid comes around and rips off one of the arms .
dad .
then you're gonna remember the time that Michael Olah took your calculator ?
took it home , put it under his bed , broke it and we hadta buy you a new one .
yeah .
yeah .
remember the time /.
it still worked .
you lost your hood ?
what hood ?
yeah .
.
Michael Olah didn't take it .
.
nobody took it .
but you could lose things , too .
and then there was some other toy you took once a piece of it /.
I'm not taking anything loose .
mm , the calculator wasn't loose .
the buttons were .
no they got loose after Michael Olah slept on it .
.
I see no reason for him to take expensive toys to school .
they're gonna beat me to death .
you promised it , didn't you , Ross ?
why will they beat you to death ?
explain it .
explain the whole deal .
they really wanna see it .
explain who these kids are that are going to beat you to death .
I wanna know because we'll report them to the teacher .
well I don't want .
I'll report on them all /.
well they're my friends .
I don't want them to get in trouble .
you don't want them you ...
you don't wanna tattle on your friends ?
I don't want any to get in trouble .
okay then I promise I wont ...
okay I wont report it to the teacher but tell me who they are .
well Steven really wants to see it .
and Michael Olah .
I thought Mike and Jerry were the ones who were beating up on you .
now there's ...
no .
now they're /.
and they're friends again ?
were going to well mm Jerry is a a good one and Michael really wants to ...
Jerry Roman ?
you mean Jerry Roman ?
yeah .
Michael really wants to see my transformer and Stevens .
and Steven really wants to see his transformer and mine .
you know that Michael and Jerry are both Romanian .
Romanian ?
Romanian .
are they ?
oh yes .
why ?
because one of theirs name is Roman .
Jerry Roman .
that means he's Romanian .
and Michael Olah , that means Romanian in Hungarian .
did you know they're both Romanian ?
uhuh .
where is /.
I'll show you where Romania is sometime .
it's right next to Hungary .
he's been to Romania .
we went to Romania .
remember .
when you almost got hit by the truck ?
oh yeah .
well where do you think I can find the Deceptigon .
boy !
are you on that again ?
we know there's one Decepticon that you're going to get for Christmas .
so all you've got to do is wait till Christmas and you can do this whole thing .
now wait a minute .
well I'll be dead .
wait a second .
are you going to take both a Decepticon and an Autobot ?
one one kid taking two fancy complex toys ?
oh I'm getting out_of this .
he hasn't even gotten permission to do the first one and he's campaigning for the second .
I don't think this is going to work Ross .
I won't bring my Autobot .
okay here's the deal .
you've got to figure out from the other kids what they're going to bring of course because tell them that your parents say that it's not fair for you to bring all the toys .
what are the other kids bringing ?
they're bringing their transformers too .
well what have they got ?
they Steven has a ambulance .
mhm .
and Michael has a little buggy like thingy .
mhm .
it's red .
mhm .
and that's what I was trying to look for only I got the one for Christmas .
mhm .
mhm .
I see .
mhm .
and ?
you have what ?
mm an autobot .
right .
the leader .
the leader of the bunch , right ?
yeah .
now .
how's this gonna work ?
well they really do wanna fight with a Deceptigon but they also need a leader !
tell them that you're gonna hafta wait until Marky's birthday party when they come .
or else you could have a meeting of Boys_club and everybody can bring a transformer .
.
you wanna do that ?
I'm dead meat .
okay .
I'll tell you what .
I've got an idea .
you're dead meat ?
okay .
if you can get a note from Michael and Jerry if they can write a note saying "/.
can Ross please bring his Autobot .
Michael and Steven .
okay .
I want them to write notes and I don't want them in your handwriting .
I want it in their handwriting .
can Ross please bring his Autobot .
okay ?
okay .
and then they say "/.
Mrs Forno says it's okay .
can they write that ?
says , s a y s .
it , i t .
is , i s .
o k .
just write o and k .
Mrs Forno says it is okay .
she can write it .
so /.
no no you write it .
or Jerry and Steve hafta write it .
can do they call you Ross or Spike ?
yeah .

can Spike please bring b r i n g his , h i s Autobot a u t o b o t .

I said /.
Marky's a good little boy Mom .
he's going to be a good little boy way into the night .
and Marky said /.

I wasn't good when you weren't here .
of course that was not what I was referring to .
I was referring to the future that he was going to be good .
I wasn't good when you weren't here .

I didn't say you were good before I said you will be good .

you know why ?

vampires are not like werewolves wait werewolves are not like robbers .

oh that's very pretty .
Ross is it hard being a first grader ?
yes but it's harder being a second one .
I know the between of dogs and cats .

and is that the between ?
that's the difference between .
from now on the daddy's are gonna get the spankings .
that's not the way it should be in this family .
uhuh .
what are you saying ?
I'm just saying that from now on the daddy's get the spankings .
I just wanted to tell you that a dog and a puppy are between each_other and a cat and a kitten are between each_other .
.
it's a wet wet day .
it's not possible .
yes it is too possible .
it's not possible .
it's as not possible as a cat can be a friend with a mouse .
well maybe they haven't been paying attention to what he did .
right ?
yeah .
that's what .
like for example what Ross ?
can't really say .
like Reagan says that the starving people in Africa and things hafta hafta work /.
can't hafta .
mhm .
for money and Mondale says why not just give the food to them .
right .
and what about war ?
yeah .
which one wants war ?
mm Ronald .
Ronny he says "/.
we'll stand up to the Russians we'll bomb them good .
you know one time he said that he that he he made a joke and he said "/.
I'm sending the missles now .
not funny .
not a very funny joke was it ?
a_lot_of people freaked out Ross .
a_lot_of rather important people .
like who ?
the Russians weren't very happy .
the Russians were not real pleased .
how would you like it if somebody destroyed your whole country ?
oh !
how would you like it if somebody made fun of something that important ?
whoa !
remember what the emperor did to Alderon ?
uhuh .
do you think we should do that ?
that's how it goes ?
mhm .
like that ?
mhm .
but there's an important problem .
what ?
how to link them together .
let's try .
you stick them together like that .
but that won't work because then they won't ...
oh .
well who knows the differences between Reagan and Mondale ?
we do .
okay what are the differences ?
Mondale says it's free lunch time and Reagan says you hafta pay .
.
Mondale says you can have a free lunch ?
yeah .

.
yeah .
mhm .
do you think there's any free lunch ?
.
well with Mondale !
.
well Ross there are lunches at your school aren't there ?
yeah but they're never free .
Ronald because most of the people in the school voted for Ronald Reagan .
in our class .

did they ?
that's why there weren't any free lunches .
yeah well it serves them right right ?
yes .
poor what about the poor kids ?
same thing .
no free lunches hafta ...
did they vote for Ronald Reagan the poor kids ?
no way they don't have enough money to have a car and vote .
mhm .
that's true .
but what about the teachers did the teachers vote for Ronald Reagan ?
mm our teacher voted for Mondale .
oh did she ?
yeah .
you know why ?
because Reagan doesn't wanna pay the teachers any money .
doesn't she ?
doesn't he .
no he doesn't wanna .
he /.
I talked to a teacher and she said that /.
teachers .
teachers were she felt that the teachers were firmly behind Mondale .
strongly Mondale .
yeah I know there's not much doubt about that .
but it doesn't seem to transcend to the /.
it's funny .
the rest of the community .
and that's why I think this ...
I'm four years old .

it's only designed to go up and down .
it's not designed to go back and forth from side to side .

and that we'd end up buying two of them and that would suffice .
two really nice coats !
well /.
it would kind of do the trick .
when I dragged out that one I thought you know this would be great !
now I saw these prices now these aren't typical prices this is a big deal /.
mhm .
sale /.
Ross do you want some Fritos ?
okay .
go ahead .
the warm weather causes a huge coat overstock .
can I have some more ?

you better not do that anymore .

the fur I got was a dreadful cheap one .
the fur was cheap right ?

the collar's good !
hm yeah .
while I felt my idea for repair was good .
but it had a a_lot_of sense to it you know ?
but the price might get beyond this in which case its stupid .
I guess we hafta decide what price /.
what grade what kind of fur are you really going for ?
would make it worth it .
you know I love fur .
you know also that a_lot_of people don't think its right to wear fur jackets okay ?
its see it as worse than smoking .
you know your attitude toward smoking in public ?
I think a_lot_of people would say the same thing about having a fur jacket .
who would ?
you would !

hm .
we're voted you in and you sold out !

Linus okay .
Linus did win .
uhuh but how about the other kids ?
did they want Charlie to win ?
oh you mean Linus .
he ran against this other kid not Charlie Brown but Russell .

how many people /.
and that was Russell himself !
and so how many /.
in fact they thought they were doomed but either .
no one voted for what ?

because and they thought it was funny .
right okay but you know something ?
what ?
how many votes did Russell get ?
thirty eight .
eighty three .
yeah eighty three .
and how many did Linus get ?
eighty four .
eighty four just one extra one .
yeah .
okay .
from Russell .
so it was a tie right ?
yeah .
that was called a tie .
it was a tie /.
okay .
until when Russell broke the tie !
mhm okay .
so can Linus fix the lockers ?
well said he would well at the end he said he really couldn't do all those things he said he would do .
he couldn't do them right ?
right .
what did he think he was going to do ?
he said well the principal is still the boss of the school .
right and so he can't do it .
now what about all the parts in the beginning when they have trouble with their stupid lockers ?
that's with Lucy I mean /.
that's not so interesting yeah /.
Sally Sally .
I think you're right so you wanna tell the whole story again one more time ?
no .

ow…ò come on !
cause you hafta do a real good job when you're up there in front of the class .
read it from the book ?
well I think what's the most funny part of the story ?
hm .
I think it's when Linus talks about the great pumpkin .
lemme see .
I think its when Linus talks and also what does Lucy do to get people to vote for Linus ?
well I think that was funny !
what did she do ?
she pull that kid by his shirt and yanked him !
you oughta tell them about that okay ?
okay .
okay tell them about that so what are you going to say ?
how did Lucy get people to vote for her brother ?
yanked one kid .
and what did she do with the other kids ?
the next kid w…ò /.
yanked him by his collar .
oh she yanked him by the collar !
yeah .
but the second kid she asked him and he said "/.

yeah .
because he forgot his lunch /.
.
yeah and one day Linus had been good to him yeah .
yeah .
and what of the other kids what'd she do to them ?
and he's /.
third kid ?
Russell Anderson .
yeah but Russell Anderson said "/.
I'm running against him /.
yeah .
so he wasn't voting but he ended up voting for him anyway .
yeah .
okay so that's the funny part and the other funny part is when Linus says instead of giving a speech he's gonna tell them about the great pumpkin .
yeah that's it .
and that made him lose a_lot_of votes don't you think ?
well then he gained them back /.
because .
then because all the kids /.
thought it was funny .
say hey he's a pretty good chameleon /.
yeah he's a pretty good comedian .

grab on to little pieces of dirt .
they yeah !
and inserts drops of water must come down .
right very good .
and then where does the water come from in the first place ?
the steam ?
yeah the steam usually .

oceans .

comes from the big oceans that live on our earth all the big oceans that are there .

Mark's waving his sword at Ross and Ross saying "/.

waving his sword at me .
waving a sword at me .
and it's true .
Mark was .
Mark was trying to intimidate Ross into doing a setup with him .
now he's shooting us .
now he's shooting us .
Mark ‚Ä° I think that you're getting over on the dark side .
you're going over to the dark side .

Marky said "/.
these are the twin boys and they go diagonally .
diagonally ?
Mary said ".
and he said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° that doesn't mean they go straight .
and he was referring to some pictures you_know from his class portraits where all the kids' pictures were all put out together and they were indeed diagonally arranged .
Mark asked me "/.
Daddy ‚Ä° what did the volcanoes erupt after ?
and I said "/.
after the earth was born .
and he asked me "/.
what did they hafta erupt for ?
they hadta erupt because it was very hot inside the earth .
.
Ross ‚Ä° I want you to come right now ‚Äû Ross .
.

you should see him in his bed .
mhm .

.
he's in his bed with his mommy .
.
because we're finished with dinner .
.
now ‚Ä° Marky asked me about why did the volcanoes hafta erupt ‚Äû Ross .
what do you know about that ?
what ?
Marky asked why did the volcanoes hafta erupt .
because the earth was too warm inside .
no ‚Ä° the earth was making land .
yeah ‚Ä° that's true but Marky had the right answer .
that's how they made land but that's not why they made land .
oh .
there's another thing that I want to tell you about .
it's not very polite at the table though .
the earth was full of gas .
so ?
hadta burp .
burp .
that's what volcanoes are .
it's when the earth is burping .
really ‚Ä° volcanic eruptions are caused largely by gas .
hot gas .
mhm .
now that's not true of lava flows but when they actually blow I think //.
actually it's a_little more complicated than that .
but gas really is involved .
more ‚Äû please .
see ‚Ä° there's pressure inside .
pressure inside the earth .
because it's very hot inside , did you know that ?
you know about the devil ?
mhm .
do you think he's real ?
unhunh .
unhunh .
he's not real .
how do we know he's not real ?
because you hafta be underground .
because that's where mud is .
he would hafta live underground .
mhm .
and they know that he can't live there .
why ?
yeah .
why can't he /?
.
it's too hot .
yeah ‚Ä° and there's mud .
first it gets muddy and then after /.
it's too hot .
he'd burn up .
nothing could survive .
nothing .
it is so /.
not even him .
even the rocks turn to gas .
I'm not kidding .
lava .
they turn to ...
yeah .
yeah ‚Ä° something .
liquid .
liquid ‚Ä° they turn to liquid .
they melt .
mm .
in fact they .
can I have some more cornbread ‚Äû please ?

you're not finished .
I'm full .
you're going fuffuffuf .
your mouth is full .
mhm .

now Ross ‚Ä° let's go back to what happened in the beginning .
do you think the oldest thing is when the earth began ?
no .
unhunh .
wanna know what the very first thing was , according to scientists ?
first the big ...
what is it called ?
planet blew up .
it's called the big ...
dipper .
no ‚Ä° you're close .
the big ...
ba .
bang .
that's the beginning .
in the world was the big bang .
what's the big bang ?
that's how the world started with a bang .
that's what scientists say .
oh ‚Ä° to come closer .
no ‚Ä° all the world was compressed into very small space , so tiny that noone could stand it .
there weren't any people .
all there were were molecules and pieces of matter .
everything in the whole world was compressed very tight ‚Äû okay ?
mhm .
and it got so tight that it went bang ‚Äû okay ?
and it blew everything out into the world , stardust all over the world .
and then /.
I thought there wasn't any world then .
then all the stardust came together and formed planets and stars and started to cool .
it was very hot .
so there is such thing as stardust .
mhm oh yeah .
my teacher keeps saying there isn't any .
stardust .
she doesn't understand what you mean by stardust .
she thinks you mean romance .
what's that ?
oh ‚Ä° stardust like what ..?
sandman dodoodidoo .
what Rainbow_Brite /.
yeah .
those .
those are called star /.
you_know ‚Ä° that stardust that she springs into life .
I can't /.
hate that .
I'm stuffed .

under the bed ?
uhhuh .
you_know ‚Ä° you know what that's made of ?
what ?
dust and crumbs .
matter .
and it all clings together .

there are different things that are called elements .
matter is in different types of elements .
hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , calcium , phosphorus , iron , nickel , cobalt , uranium , .
pancakes ?
what ?
pancakes ?
pancakes are made of carbohydrates .
they're a union of carbon atoms , oxygen atoms , and hydrogen atoms .
oh ‚Ä° like oxygen .
oxygen is one you breathe .
you breathe .
yeah .
and nitrogen is in the air too ‚Äû nitrogen .
argon , xenon , those are sort_of rare .
but that stuffie on the ground , gravity , it keeps you down .
but in space there's no gravity so you go up and down like that .
right ‚Ä° that's right .
and in space there's no air to breathe , no oxygen , no nitrogen /.
yeah ‚Ä° so you need a little spacesuit on .
mhm .
how do you get to breathe with a spacesuit on ?
got a bunch of oxygen on your back .
in a tank full of ...
all stuffed together real tight .
a bottle full of ...
bottle of oxygen .
but how do you eat with taking off your helmet ?
don't take it off .
you'll die .
well ‚Ä° how do you get to eat that way ?
wait until you get back into your spaceship .
then you can eat .
in the spaceship /.
when you get in your spaceship then it's safe .
it has air in it .
oh ‚Ä° because you hafta open the spaceship when you're going up in space .
right .
how'd you learn that ?
so when you open the thingie , air comes in .
mhm right .
how did you learn about that ?
I didn't learn about it .
you didn't ?
do people ever teach you those things at school ?
unhunh .

right ‚Ä° you know what they eat for lunch when Rossy goes to eat lunch at school ?

that's why Ross doesn't like to eat lunch there .
you mean they take out knuckles ?
yeah ‚Ä° from people .
ugh !

no .
they're just pretend knuckle sandwiches .
they don't really eat knuckle sandwiches .
yeah ‚Ä° they're just plain sandwiches .
they're just plain regular sandwiches that regular people eat , like peanutbutter and jelly and stuff like that ‚Äû right ?
yeah ‚Ä° just like Cheerios with peanutbutter on it .
Marky ‚Ä° can I ask you a question ?
what ?

I peed in my pants and my /.

I just don't know .
well ‚Ä° I don't know either .

Mark's gonna tell the taperecorder a story .
go ahead ‚Äû Mark .
once_upon_a_time there was a little baby .
once_upon_a_time there was a little baby .
once_upon_a_time there was a little baby .
he was called Mark .
and one time he played with his friend .
and we said "/.
friendie ‚Ä° can I go upstairs ?
and the friendie said "/.
mm ‚Ä° after my tv .
and baby Marky said "/.
why don't you go ?
and he says "/.
because I hafta do more work .
and he says "/.
what work ?
and the boy says "/.
my homework .
and the baby says "/.
what is homework ?
is it things at home work and you hafta do it ?
and he says "/.
no ‚Ä° it's leftovers from your school .
ah ‚Ä° so leftovers are left up clothes .
no ‚Ä° they're left up papers .
worky papers .
and the baby said "/.
oh .
and then the boy said "/.
I hafta get to my work so go and eat your jelly .
and then the baby said "/.
okay .
they run around and then he almost ran in^to the wall but he stopped and walked over back to jelly .
and he said "/.
well ‚Ä° I think this is naptime so I'll hurry up and eat my jelly .
and that was the big swallow .
well ‚Ä° I'm able go to bed .
wake up .
I says ".
and then he said "/.
who is that ?
a monster who came in to scare every people ?
he won't scare me .
I am Mister_T .
they said "/.
no ‚Ä° I'm your father .
and he says "/.
well ‚Ä° I never knew you were ‚Äû hahaha .
and then they lived happily ever after .
where's off button ?
you shouldn't stop it ‚Äû Mark .
well ‚Ä° how do you stop it ?
what button ?
a button where ?
.
oh sure .
alright .
few days back Mark and I went for the bus and because I was dashing for the bus in the car , he said "/.
I wish that some people didn't hafta sit in the car and listen to other people get mad at the bus .
I wasn't even cursing the bus at that point but it's typical that I get down to the end of the street and the bus is already past and hasn't bothered to stop or anything and I curse out the bus .
and so Mark has been trying to get me to stop saying anything about the bus even when we miss it by a hair .
Ross was talking about "/.
Dad ‚Ä° you know that you're gonna be here on the first day of spring and Mom's gonna be in California ?
and I said "/.
yeah Ross ‚Ä° I know .
I looked at the calendar .
that's right .
and he said "/.
but Dad you_know ‚Ä° you hafta admit that Mommy makes better Valentine's day cakes .
but we'll save some for you .
this has to do with the fact //.
what was interesting was sort_of the leap that he made which was connecting the fact that I'm going to be back for the first day of spring and that //.
there was one other thing that went in_between those .
I said "/.
will you miss your mom ?
he said "/.
yeah ‚Ä° sure we will .
and he said "/.
but Dad you_know ‚Ä° you hafta admit that Mommy makes better Valentine's day cakes .
but we'll save some for you when you get back .
and what he's saying is //.
not Valentine's day .
Saint_Patrick's day cakes .
I'm sorry .
Saint_Patrick's day cakes .
and /.
he never mentioned Saint_Patricks before then ?
no ‚Ä° we had .
we had talked before about the fact that I would be missing Saint_Patrick's day when I'm in Paris .
going to Paris and Rome and I'd be missing Saint_Patrick's day .
but I guess he figured out that he would save some things .
and so what he's saying is "/.
it's okay that we have Mother for Saint_Patrick's day and you for the first day of spring because after_all Mommy makes better Saint_Patrick's day cakes than you would .
so that's appropriate that she should be there for Saint_Patrick's day .
and don't worry ‚Äû Dad .
we'll save you some .
so it'll all be okay .
he's getting it all ready in his mind , how it's gonna be for various holidays and things when people are going to be going on trips .
Ross climbed over the banister .
and as he did I noticed that the banister cut him right between the legs .
and I gave him this rather startled look or concerned look and I said "/.
oo ‚Ä° right on the privates .
and by this time he was standing up and he looks me straight in the eye for a moment like he was trying to absorb what I said .
and then his face broke into a smile and he said "/.
oh ‚Ä° I'm built like a monkey .
oh ‚Ä° it's okay .
I'm built like a monkey .
I don't get hurt .
something like that .
because he was shocked and then to cover up his shock he thought he could use a clever retort .
Marky said "/.
you_know Mom ‚Ä° if we just clean up the fireplace this house would look really clean .
he said this .
he was in the kitchen .
we hadn't been around the fireplace at all .
right .
this had nothing to do with the fireplace .
it was some kind of an adult remark stolen straight from Brian but Brian wasn't around and this wasn't something that had been ...
you_know ‚Ä° this was Mark trying to act like he had everything under control .
right ‚Ä° cute .
saw a bunch of trophies at school today and he said "/.
guess what .
on that side //.
and he pointed to one side of the room .
had the most trophies .
and then he pointed to the other side of the room and he said "/.
and this side had the less trophies .
what's wrong ‚Äû Marky ?
I can't figure out what the last school is called .
Schoolname .
I forget .
yeah .
one time at Schoolname we had a //.
well ‚Ä° we got to go in the place where we saw the wizard .
mhm .
you know that place ?
.
in the school it's called the Gym^ner .
it's the Gymner .
yeah .
and one time the teacher came down real fast and she was behind us and we didn't know she was coming down and she said "/.
skip to the back wall .
and we didn't know she was coming down to say that .
mhm ‚Ä° and did you hafta do what she said ?
yeah ‚Ä° and Jimmy hadta ...
he hadta practice skipping .
can you skip ?
yeah .
Marky can also eat a_lot_of Cheerios .
they're up^stairs talking about the construction of the Ewok village type idea that they're planning for the summer in the backyard .
and Mark says "/.
we have a rope longer than that rope .
so we can make one like this .
you_know ‚Ä° they're gonna go and talk some more about that .
.
.
yeah in it .
oh ‚Ä° here's another one .
there's a_lot_of these .
.
and guess what .
the swing guy is flipping down from this one line .
.
is that the ladder ?
no ‚Ä° it's a four .
no ‚Ä° I meant is this the ladder .
yeah ‚Ä° .
because it seemed the ladder is here //.
oh ‚Ä° there's the ladder .

I'll tell you what it is .
the bottom's stuck .
is there a_lot_of stuff now ?
no ‚Ä° it's not too much .
did you figure which tree you're gonna put it on ?
I'd say this is a ladder to get down .
well ‚Ä° we will hafta build a ladder ‚Äû you_know .
yeah ‚Ä° to get up and down from the trees .
mhm ‚Ä° you'd be surprised how hard it is to build things .
I know .

in the dinosaur ages there was these big blobs of mud that shrinks that is deep .
in the dinosaur ages there was these big blobs of mud that shrinks that is deep .
mhm .
and even baby these guys and daddy these guys and mommy these guys , every animal could sink into that .
they sink into the mud .
and then what happens to the mud ?
well ‚Ä° it went to these guys .
mhm ‚Ä° and what do we do with it ?

I mean like ...
oil and gas .
well /.
what do you mean like , Mark ?
I mean like never_mind .
mommy these guys and baby these guys refer to the dinosaurs by the way .
okay Mark well ...
it's ...
what about the tar ?
did animals ever sink into tar ?
yeah .
when was that and was that in the old days ?
that's what I was talking about , the tar .
oh ‚Ä° the tar that they sank into .
yeah .
you mean when the dinosaurs sank into the tar ?
yeah ‚Ä° and then it turned like solid .
mhm .
it turned solid in these days .
right .
in these days it's solid and you can't shrink into it because it's solid .
we know that .
you can't sink into it .
yeah ‚Ä° it's solid tar .
you can't sink into it .
like a street when they cover up the road with tar and it gets really hard ?
then it's solid tar ‚Äû right ?
yeah ‚Ä° these days it's not soft tar that the dinosaurs shrinked into .
but there is soft tar you can sink into still .
these days ?
sure ‚Ä° you can still find places to sink in .
where ?
oh ‚Ä° in Trinidad .
Trinidad ?
sure ‚Ä° they have tar pits there .
they do ?
sure ‚Ä° there are tar pits there .
could we ever go there ?
would you like to //?
yes ‚Ä° we could go there and sink into the tar pits .
are you sure they're hiding ?
sure ‚Ä° we could do it .
what ?
are they hiding ?
no no ‚Ä° you just go there and sink right in and that's the end of you .
are they hiding ?
no .
who , the dinosaurs ?
who's hiding ?
are the pits hiding ?
no no ‚Ä° the pits aren't hiding .
they're all around you ?
they're all around you .
mm ‚Ä° like there's a skinny spot you can stand .
yeah ‚Ä° and then sometimes you'll slip off of the skinny part right into the tar pit .
why ?
is that sure ?
that's for sure .
no ‚Ä° it should be like about this wide maybe .
it should so you don't really slip in ?
yeah .
no ‚Ä° you'll probably slip in .
no I_mean ‚Ä° like it can be this /.
maybe we shouldn't go there .
maybe we just shouldn't go there .
no I_mean //.
you mean the car could sink too ?
oh yeah ‚Ä° everything sinks right into those tar pits .
is the road have tar pits ?
there's no road .
it's sunk in .
sunk in .
hm .
you understand ?
I wish I was a monkey .
and I could swing across California and across everywhere .
yeah ‚Ä° that would be a good idea .
why don't you do that next time you're born ‚Äû okay ?
next time you're born you gotta be a monkey ‚Äû okay ?
no ‚Ä° next time I'm born I'm going to be a animal and I hope I'm going to be a monkey .
you're hoping .

you better let your mommy sleep now .
she's very tired .
okay .
here ‚Ä° turn the taperecorder off now .
know what my dinosaurs turned into ?
what ?
bones .
.
they had bones in their bodies in the first place .
I know .
and then they turned into bones .
they died and they turned into bones .
they dried up and then their skin tore off .
and the bones sank because the bones were so heavy .
they were .
the bones were heavy .
but how come dogs can hold up bones ?
what ?
how come dogs can hold up bones ?
because they're not as big and heavy .
you mean the puppy is stronger ?
doesn't have heavy bones .
oh ‚Ä° bones don't have heavy bones .
your doggy didn't have big bones .
the dinosaur had such big heavy bones that it was easier for him to stay inside of the water so that he didn't hafta carry around all that weight .
those guys went in the water because they were so big and they had big heavy bones , heavier than that .
.
Mom .
mhm ?
how did ..?
how did what ?
how can you have a different kind of child ?
like kind_of like a monster ?
how can you have that kind of child ?
oh ‚Ä° that's when you have a baby that didn't grow right .
oh ‚Ä° like maybe the feet got like twisted .
right .
.
you take a cute little boy like you .
no , Brian .
and you tickle them too much and they turn into monsters .
no .
mhm .
unhunh .
well ‚Ä° how else are you gonna do it ?
there's one more way .
what's that ?
how to make a monster .
how ?
you get a dinosaur and /.
you get married to a dinosaur .
and yeah ‚Ä° and then ya tear the skin off .
and yeah ‚Ä° and then ya tear the skin off .
and yeah ‚Ä° and then ya tear the skin off .
uhhuh .
and then you be the dinosaur .
and then you'll be eaten .
aten ?
what's the right way to say aten ?
eaten .
very good .
because if you do that mistake the meat eaters are gonna get ya .
.
the meat eaters are gonna get ya ‚Äû right ?
mhm .
hey ‚Ä° how would they know that that thing is alive ?
because the skin is all parachute down because it would be too big .
the skin would be too big .
the skin would all parachute down on you because it would be too big ?
yeah .
why ‚Ä° wouldn't you have the bones there anymore ?
/.
or I thought you said you'd take the skin off the bones .
yeah ‚Ä° you would take the skin off the guy .
and use it ?
but I don't think they would try and eat you .
mhm ?
because it would all //.
once you tape it , it would all parachute on .
where would you tape it ?
where else ?
on the cut .
you hadta cut /.
oh ‚Ä° tape the cut back up .
yeah .
and what would you do to the skin ?
oh ‚Ä° that's when you go into /.
you go into it .
it won't be too sharp .
uhhuh .
and it will be really rough to cut through and to tape .
because the top skin is gonna be kind_of bumpy .
bumpy .
like and made like kind_of like rock .
oh ‚Ä° really rough ‚Äû huh ?
yeah ‚Ä° really rough .
and once you get in you hafta tape it .
uhhuh .
and I don't think that would be comfy in there .
inside ?
yeah .
so ‚Ä° you're gonna cut the skin off a dinosaur and take it off and then climb inside and tape it back up ?
yeah ‚Ä° except you hafta take all the bones and blood and veins and heads and eyeballs out .
right ‚Ä° and then /.
it's disgusting .
and then the skin is gonna parachute down on you .
once you get in and tape it up it's gonna parachute down on you .
now ‚Ä° what's gonna parachute down on you ?
I think I shouldn't have asked .
no ‚Ä° we've got it all figured out here .
is this to become a monster ?
is this how you get to be a monster ?
yeah ‚Ä° except I don't think it's gonna be working .
why not ?
you would hafta get a small one .
a small dinosaur ?
yeah ‚Ä° and that would be hard to do it because it would //.
well ‚Ä° there must be .
and you'd know which one it would be .
which one , baby ?
no ‚Ä° the one with the rough rough bumpy things .
oh ‚Ä° you mean like /?
stegosaurus .
stegosaurus ?
or the one with the spiked tail .
that's stegosaurus .
oh ‚Ä° rough and bumpy //.
you might mean ankylosaurus .
or maybe that other vicious one .
Tyrannosaurus_Rex ?
no ‚Ä° that other vicious one .
you're joking .
do you mean the meat eater ?
no ‚Ä° another of the plant eaters .
are they vicious ?
yep ‚Ä° they're vicious .
plant eaters are vicious because they hit you with their tail ‚Äû huh ?
yeah ‚Ä° like one of them has a //.
one of them are stupid .
have a stupid brain .
uhhuh .
a little brain up in his head so the tail has a brain and it can tell the brain up here when a guy is coming after .
and there's one with a spiked tail and one with a bumpy thing like .
but there's one of those little plates with those plates .
lots_of details .
I'm sure you couldn't eat dinner on the plates .
I'm sure you couldn't eat dinner on the plates .
on which plates , Mark ?
the plates of the dinosaur .
oh ‚Ä° those plates .
what if you cut them off ?
then you could eat dinner on those plates .
very funny , Dad .
you would hafta try it once you would get //.
I don't think you could be a monster that way either because they would kill you .
mhm .
the one with the plates and the one with the spiked tail , most of the one with the spiked tail .
mhm ‚Ä° does baby have any of these things ?
he has /.

and Blaster useta be a Decepticon .
and Soundwave and Blaster were brothers .
yeah .
and they were on the same team called the Decepticon which are the bad guy teams ‚Äû okay ?
and then Soundwave hates Megatron's guts .
Megatron is the leader of the Decepticons .
but he doesn't show it .
and he played a trick on Megatron and Megatron thought it was Blaster .
and Blaster got mad at Soundwave and turned to the Autobots' side ‚Äû okay ?
and now he's really mad at Soundwave because he keeps playing tricks on the Autobots .
so he took himself and played tricks on the Decepticons .
I see .
and on the commercial you'll see that Rumble is carrying around this radio and he says "/.
hey ‚Ä° look at this great music I found .

and then when Megatron started the Decepticons were against the Autobots first for who shall rule the universe .
the Autobots didn't want anybody to rule but the Decepticons wanted to rule .
mhm .
and then Starscream and Skyfire or that's what they call him on the cartoon //.

you_know ‚Ä° it was a perfect use of it rhetorically .
it's just the only place where the rhetorical use and the meaningful use that is of really resting something both could cooccur .
in other words , Mark could use it rhetorically correctly but didn't hafta use it metaphorically .
that is , the idea of resting a case metaphorically was not something he wanted to buy into yet .
so he wanted to use it in a specifically undergeneralized way but still appropriate with the situation .

I was talking to Ross about //.
he was asking me who is my //.
let's see .
who in my family liked me the most , was I the most favorite of .
or something like that .
and I said "/.
well ‚Ä° my mother .
and then I said "/.
well ...
no ‚Ä° he said "/.

and I said "/.

you told me once that you had your father wrapped around your finger .
or "/.
you had your dad wrapped around your little finger .
.
you had your dad wrapped around your little finger .
and this is true .
but the thing is I can't remember how long ago that was .
it was really quite a long time ago .
I think it was at the beginning of this year sometime or at least at the beginning of the school year .
but anyway he remembered it and he remembered how to say it also .
I heard Mark say "/.
we don't want no soap in the water .
and Ross said back to him "/.
any , Mark .
any .
it's we don't want any soap in the water .
Mark ‚Ä° you have disgusting language .

I just made a mistake , Ross .
I gave Mark a drink of water because he wasn't quite //.

so he finished the water and he said "/.
thank_you , Mom .
the more I drink , the more eat ...
with little hand movements .
the more faster I fall asleep .
Mark was having trouble with reading some books that we got him and Mark said "/.
it's because the words are too little .
and Ross said "/.
the reason he can't read it is because he can't see the words on the page .
so my suggestion is that when he wants to read the words you write them up on a piece of paper so that he can see them .
and what was interesting about that was this "/.
my suggestion is ...
Mark's suggestion is ...
business was well used .
it was like part of a general solution to a problem that everybody was facing at this point .
actually Mark's causing us all a_lot_of problems right now .
he's sort_of being a little bit difficult , let's say .
sposta reach something so that he can get a He_Man toy .
Ross that he was just Mister_Wonderful just like when he was a baby .
he said "/.
Mister_Wonderful the wrestler ?
"/.
no , no .
and then he said "/.
there is such a guy .
in other words , that's the first use of such in that specific sense that I'd ever noticed .

you know those ones I hadta eat so I could get my doughnut ?
I just keep them in my mouth ...
