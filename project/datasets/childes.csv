the bad guys and talk to each_other .,child
once upon a time a long time ago in outer space there was this this little planet full of trees and mountains .,child
there are these little creatures there who live in these little tents .,child
they were called Ewoks .,child
the planet of the Ewoks had been very old .,child
the Ewoks had made many .,child
very many very less burners there because they loved the beautiful smell of the air .,child
and they knew if they burned too much fire for their firecamp when they go out hiking in the mountains it would burn it would burn their special cave that they had under the ground where all the mountains were covering it .,child
they kept a little weapons up up in the little drawer in their little coats of fur .,child
when they were going out hunting to find firewood they took their little coats and put them on with their weapons inside so if any people tried to take them away they can scare them away from them .,child
and they have these little creatures to ride on named named .,child
they're named they're named Treestompers .,child
because they loved to stomp on trees .,child
they eat the little Ewoks do not let them because they think that they might step on them by accident .,child
so they so when they wanna step on trees they tie them to the trees instead of stepping on them .,child
one day when they were going up up in the mountains they put their coats on but the weapons their weapons fell out .,child
and they were riding up the mountain and a big blob of slime came rolling down the hill .,child
their and the little Treestompers did not see it rolling down their Wonder cave .,child
and it was heading right for their weapons when they heard a little squeak of a mouse that was inside .,child
they rushed down the hill and into the dwarf .,child
and the slime was heading to the to their weapons .,child
so_that he could gobble them up .,child
then they had little extra weapons that were kind of like lightsabers except expect when they pressed the button light didn't come only little bullets that can stop things from eating up the weapons .,child
so they took those little extra weapons out and aimed them at the slime .,child
then they ran to get their weapons stuck them on their coat but they fell out the hole that they came out .,child
then that very night they hadta sew the bottom of their pockets so_that when they put their little weapons in they would stay that way in .,child
so the next morning when they went out to ride for firewood they this big planet called Mountainflade was coming was coming towards the mountains and trees of the planet Ewokstam where the Ewoks all was coming right right to smack it .,child
they went on their horses to the very top of the mountain that reached to the very top of space and they saw this big ball and it it was Mountainstomp .,child
and it was headed right for for their home to smash it .,child
so they took their little weapons and raised them right at it and shot it and it blew up into a thousand pieces .,child
"then some human popped out_of the hole and they said ""/.",child
stand still still .,child

I'll tell you a ...,child
once in a galaxy far far far far far far far far far away ...,child
there once was a pilot and a copilot /.,child
named Han Solo and and Chewbacca .,child
there we were they were out .,child
trying to see who hadta take a pilot .,child
mm for a ride somewhere .,child
once in a bar there some gangsters pushed Han around but Han just blasted them .,child
they were dead .,child
I know .,child
the guys who bugged the the monsters who bugged Han and Chewy .,child
and once the two the a young lad named Luke Skywalker came into the bar .,child
well he came in a Sand^speeder .,child
and Ben Kenobi the old desert ...,child
I mean ...,child
the old desert hermit came with him .,child
he gave him a light saber and taught him half of the force .,child
but they came with two Droids too .,child
and they hadta leave them out_of the bar because they could have been damaged .,child
and there were no Droids allowed in the bar .,child
and when they came into this little place with a table and Han with Chewy were there .,child
and they asked if they could go to Alderon in their ship .,child
"and Han and Chewbacca said ""/.",child
sure but it'll cost you plenty !,child
they went but by accident when they flew off stormtroopers knocked out their engine and they couldn't steer it .,child
I'm changing a little bit .,child
and they /.,child
they hadta put on a forcefield so if they crashed they would like bounce away .,child
and when they soon came near Alderon they couldn't believe what they saw !,child
Alderon was destroyed !,child
there was an asteroid where it was blasted .,child
then near it was the Death_Star .,child
they were being sucked in .,child
"then when they were in , the Lord Darth and his captive Empire checked the the ship .",child
but there was no passengers .,child
they were hiding in the compartments .,child
and when one stormtrooper came Chewbacca opened his lid and threw them down and stuffed his fist in his mouth .,child
and went arr and Chewy knocked him out .,child
and he closed his lid .,child
and he and he gave the suit to Luke .,child
and Han was in there too .,child
and so Chewby open his lid again and got another stormtrooper and knocked him out .,child
and closed the lid and gave the thing to Han .,child
and then and then Ben Kenobi got out the hatch /.,child
and he was with the switch with Invisopower and he turned on Invisopower so he could get through .,child
and he tried to turn tried to like free Leia .,child
by accident she was caught with Darth Vader .,child
and meanwhile Luke and Han they got some chains like wristbands ...,child
and put them on Chewy .,child
and they pretended that they were taking a prisoner down to see Darth Vader .,child
and by accident or well they were trapped .,child
and stormtroopers kept shooting across .,child
no not yet .,child
I'm not making it not yet .,child
I'm making it not yet I mean .,child
but then when they shot they shot Chewbacca .,child
he was dead .,child
I'm making it up .,child
and they hadta heal his skin if he was left stay so well Luke had a an firstaid kit from home .,child
and he had some bandaid and they taped up his skin .,child
no it was an arrow .,child
shooting out_of the gun .,child
and well then they went on and by accident they were caught between Darth Vader and his group .,child
and they found a hatch and when they ran they slipped into it .,child
they went like nyeer and they dropped into where Leia was .,child
so then they got her free and when the stormtroopers were blasting at them they had Luke shot a door through the wall and they swang into a garbage dump !,child
when the garbage dump kept closing Luke was pulled under by a worm !,child
he was almost killed .,child
no I'm still suppose to go .,child
and when they shot at that worm they hadta get the walls from closing .,child
so they found this big metal bar but it crushed the bar .,child
so they had to contact R_two_D_two and C_three_P_O and they freed them .,child
well first they touched B_one and that stopped the walls from closing and sucked the worm under .,child
no three-d sucked the worm under .,child
so and then R_two_D_two and C_three_P_O threw down a rope and tied it to someplace and they climbed up .,child
and then they got to the Falcon .,child
and meanwhile Darth Vader and Ben Kenobi were fighting .,child
and Darth flang up his light saber and so did Ben .,child
and then by well Ben damaged I mean Vader .,child
and then Vader threw his light saber into his clothes .,child
and he and then there was nothing when he shattered down but his clothes .,child
and they were still running to the ship and when they got out they hadta fight these things ?,child
Luke got four hundred and Han got nine thousand .,child
so they they broke the time barrier .,child
if they were gonna get out_of there .,child
when they got down to where the rest of the base was they hadta plan their attack against the Empire .,child
and Luke volunteered for an X_wing when they were fighting against the Empire .,child
Luke blasted nine thousand hundred .,child
and the other guys were blown up .,child
and then it was between Darth Vader and Luke .,child
and Luke let go .,child
"and one sarge he said ""/.",child
what's happening to you ?,child
Luke I'm fine .,child
and Han flew down and Darth blasted at him .,child
then Han flew down and he put on his shield .,child
so and Han got out_of there .,child
so Luke could fire his dynamite so they went bzoom and blasted Darth Vader's ship .,child
he had a parachute of course .,child
and then when they got back /.,child
they received the medals .,child
that's the end .,child

Johnny Appleseed .,child
I thought Johnny Appleseed .,child
why do you why does it fall ?,child

the reason why they fall is because nothing's holding them up so the center of gravity is pulling them down .,child
like right in the center of the earth .,child
Mr wizard's world .,child
why do they come down ?,child
because this one it holds this piece there so the air catches it up and only only sometimes he loses air up on top /.,child

and him with that too .,child
no the stuff fell .,child
when he lands .,child
how does it fall ?,child
how does it get up ?,child
the way it falls is because /.,child
why does it fall ?,child

cause oh because he's like fighting against the center of gravity to get up .,child
his muscles and his bones .,child
and the muscles and the bones and the heart are all together fighting /.,child
with the center of gravity .,child

is Ratchael in there ?,adult
who's in there ?,adult
this is June the second .,adult
and Mary's going to tell about what Ross's done this morning .,adult
Ross took his bath /.,adult
mhm .,adult
and he threw doo_doo all over the floor /.,adult
mhm .,adult
and when I walked in I saw it .,adult
doo_doo doo_doo .,adult
caca /.,adult
"poo , poo .",adult
poo excuse me .,adult
and .,adult
I walked in and saw it /.,adult
uhuh .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
oh_my_goodness !,adult
mhm .,adult
"and Ross looked at me and he said ""/.",adult
oh_my_goodness !,adult
and then he said /.,adult
how did he say it ?,adult
let's hear how he said it .,adult
oh he mushed it .,adult
oh my /.,adult
.,adult
he said oh no .,adult
oh_my_goodness .,adult
the goodness was mushed but the oh was clear .,adult
oh_my_goodness .,adult
"and then he said ""/.",adult
oh my !,adult
oh my .,adult
was that clear .,adult
"it was pretty clear considering I understood ""/.",adult
oh_my_goodness .,adult
and I was sort of listening .,adult
mhm .,adult
yeah .,adult
"and then he said ""/.",adult
oh wow !,adult
oh wow .,adult
I was trying to figure out what that one was but that was clear too .,adult
it was clear enough .,adult
uhhuh .,adult
he doesn't say anything clear .,adult
just now /.,adult
he says don't very clearly .,adult
no he doesn't .,adult
he says unt .,adult
he says du .,adult
don .,adult
well he doesn't say it clearly though .,adult
he doesn't say don't .,adult
pretty clear .,adult
okay .,adult
and then just a few minutes ago I gave him a piece of coconut which he had been pointing at and wanting .,adult
mhm .,adult
and so I gave it to him .,adult
and he said thank_you .,adult
thank_you .,adult
Mary wants to tell us a story about Mike Spratt .,adult
I think he means mine .,adult
mine ?,adult
mine ?,adult
okay .,adult
you wanna tell us a story about Mike Spratt now Mary .,adult
please ?,adult
oh .,adult
mike Spratt came over .,adult
and as_soon_as Ross realized that I'm not sure this is such a good story !,adult
tell it !,adult
huh .,adult
as_soon_as Ross realized that Mike was there he began to bring him the Leggo dolls .,adult
one by one .,adult
uhuh .,adult
and then he became became involved in a game with Mike .,adult
uhuh .,adult
this was very nonverbal !,adult
mhm ?,adult
oh I know he wanted all the doll back from Mike that was it .,adult
after he gave them all to him .,adult
so he'd take them one by one .,adult
well at least he took the first one and then he'd put it on the window sill .,adult
mhm .,adult
then he asked Mike for the next one and Mike gave it to him .,adult
and he asked Mike for the third one but Mike would not give him the third one until Ross put the second one on the windowsill also .,adult
mhm .,adult
and I guess Mike guided his hand that time .,adult
mhm .,adult
so the third and fourth time around Ross got the hang of the game .,adult
so when people insist on him doing things he will do things .,adult
yeah he got the game very very quickly .,adult
I agree .,adult
I agree it wasn't that interesting .,adult
what was that ?,adult

he seems to like the idea of one single gesture .,adult
let's see .,adult
some other word he was saying you could just see where he had gotten the intonation but that was about all .,adult
he got the whole feel of the word .,adult
but he didn't have little details very good .,adult
he had the contour really .,adult
the intonational contour of it .,adult
oh .,adult
but keys .,adult
like keys .,adult
you've got the rising contour and /.,adult
I don't know what else .,adult
the aspiration really .,adult
things that extended through the whole syllable were probably were better than ones that were just located in part of it .,adult
what's that ?,adult
keys ?,adult
there he goes .,adult
keys .,adult
0do you want these keys too ?,adult
taperecorder .,adult
taperecorder .,adult

go out and tell your father you're sorry .,adult
get down off the bed and go out and tell Daddy you're sorry .,adult
and he did .,adult
"and he said it very nicely "".",adult
and this morning speaking of politeness and all that .,adult
he climbed up on the chair and asked me for something .,adult
very nicely .,adult
and now I'm telling him to stop whining .,adult
I don't want you whining .,adult
uhhuh .,adult
for example I'm going downstairs .,adult
okay .,adult
don't whine .,adult
yeah .,adult
basically if you agree to do what he wants .,adult
uhhuh .,adult
something nice .,adult
and you tell him stops whining .,adult
he'll stop whining .,adult
he'll stop .,adult
if you don't tell him to stop whining he'll continue .,adult
yeah yeah .,adult
you've gotta be very explicit in what you say .,adult
okay .,adult
"I was fooling with his nose and he said ""/.",adult
oh !,adult
he doesn't want no more help daddy .,adult
I got that coming up .,adult
he wanted me to get his stick .,adult
he was outside and he wanted to come in .,adult
"he says ""/.",adult
and we were watching tv oh here's Marky .,adult
that was the cat .,adult
that's not Marky .,adult
okay what will Mark talk about ?,adult
we saw the Gonk and the Glimore something on tv .,adult
these are some Wug type nonsense nonsense muppets .,adult
lived on some silly planet .,adult
"and about two hours later he asked me ""/.",adult
he really wanted the Gonk .,adult
what's going on ?,adult
that's Marky in the background .,adult
"he's going ""/.",adult
dadadada .,adult
where's the ball ?,adult
what happened to the ball ?,adult
I thought that was rather nice .,adult
he just learned the word Seth .,adult
and did it rather nicely in a little sentence .,adult
not to roady .,adult
what are you doing ?,adult
and this was a lie .,adult
because he had run out to try to find me .,adult
because he thought I was driving away .,adult
and I got out there and caught him in the act of looking for me .,adult
and also being out in the front yard where he's not sposta be .,adult
"so he said ""/.",adult
I think he was really lying basically .,adult
he wasn't doing pee_pee on the grass ?,adult
no no he tried .,adult
go ahead and do it .,adult
he couldn't do it .,adult
because he didn't wanna in the first place .,adult
he didn't wanna do pee_pee .,adult
he calls his bottle Flintstones .,adult
"means I don't want my bottle ""/.",adult
may I say that last week it was Barney .,adult
yeah he calls it Barney .,adult
and calls it bottle and now it's Flintstones .,adult
he's got lots_of names for it .,adult
he's changing around a lot .,adult
yeah he has names for his bottle .,adult
yeah .,adult
he was looking for spoons or pencils I guess .,adult
as_if I want another also or I want another one too .,adult
I wasn't sure .,adult
I want one too I'm not sure .,adult
he might be confusing those .,adult
yeah that's what I was thinking .,adult
he's very into numbers .,adult
two and two right .,adult
I heard that sort of confusion before .,adult
I want two .,adult
I want it too .,adult
where's the other one ?,adult
oh here it is .,adult
what was that Mary ?,adult
what you found ?,adult
okay something .,adult
.,adult
I'm going to take off your pants .,adult
so it looked like he was building it up out_of the units .,adult
don't take off .,adult
"and then what ""/.",adult
don't take off my pants .,adult
and then he kind of readjusted because he like it better with the idea that off would follow pants .,adult
so don't take my pants off .,adult
he likes that better .,adult
so he kind of correct himself essentially to that .,adult
and I was cleaning his nose a lot this morning and trying to fix him up .,adult
he was having a_lot_of problems .,adult
giving him medicine .,adult
giving him medicine right .,adult
and he really was getting unhappy .,adult
we told me we were trying to help him .,adult
trying to help him .,adult
try to help him feel better .,adult

I take away Marky a bear .,adult
and it was from Marky .,adult
very carefully .,adult

instead of saying you go to sleep like he usually says .,adult
also he smokes about anything now as a pipe .,adult
he smokes a pencil and what did he smoke this morning a teaspoon ?,adult
yeah .,adult
okay .,adult
three times very insistently .,adult
it's sort of like he got pleasure out_of saying it three times .,adult

oh and then I put out some new sponges .,adult
it's a nice fresh sponge .,adult
nice fresh sponge .,adult

and he imitated it nice fresh sponge .,adult
and what he meant was let's go inside .,adult
so he confuses outside inside .,adult

we were down moving some furniture down at the department and there was a table and I moved it away while Ross didn't see .,adult

"I had taken he had said ""/.",adult
I pulled him out_of the bed and I was holding him .,adult
"he said ""/.",adult
you are uppie .,adult
so I put him down .,adult
could get up into his chair .,adult
heavy means hard but also means heavy .,adult
I don't know if he was referring to himself as being too heavy or what .,adult

Ross is sick .,adult
Daddy's sick .,adult

right .,adult
"the interesting part of this discussion was Ross said ""/.",adult

yeah but in meat eaters where's the meat ?,adult
so on the meat eaters the meat is all over and on the planter eaters don't have any meat ?,adult
Ross that can't be right .,adult
that doesn't make sense .,adult
all animals are full with meat .,adult
meat eater means they eat meat .,adult
dad ?,adult

what is that ?,adult
bologna and mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it's not Marky .,adult
oh .,adult
it's not butter .,adult
is that butter ?,adult
no .,adult
they're recording .,adult
that's okay .,adult
Ross it doesn't make any sense .,adult
to say that the plant eaters don't have any meat .,adult
is this butter ?,adult
because their bodies are made of meat .,adult
your body is made of meat .,adult
only if you eat meat .,adult
you have meat in it .,adult
yeah you have meat in your body .,adult
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat .,adult
you see you gotta understand something okay ?,adult
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all over your body .,adult
muscles .,adult
muscles muscles are meat .,adult
you take plants okay you you see that apple sauce ?,adult
that's not meat is it ?,adult
now if you eat that apple sauce what's going to happen ?,adult
no your going to make apple sauce arms ?,adult
no .,adult
which is right unless you want seconds or thirds or in_case you want seconds or thirds ?,adult
which one did you say ?,adult
what's the difference ?,adult
hum ?,adult
it make more sense ?,adult

right a pony has four legs .,adult
very good .,adult
I wanna interject that I believe that this comes from you telling him that you didn't even wanna hear him asking .,adult
not tonight but other times .,adult
there has been quite a deal made over asking .,adult
sometime I do I don't even wanna hear you ask for it .,adult
yeah and ...,adult
and so he asked could I ask ...,adult
yeah and it sounds like a politeness form but it actually has a very obvious function may I ask can I get away with it .,adult
well he may have I doubt I doubt that explanation .,adult
I can't imagine but he you know ...,adult
certainly certainly it could be supported it could be supported .,adult
"Ross said ""/.",adult

is that right Ross ?,adult
Marky that's not fair .,adult

yeah he says bomit .,adult
Ross you just make your daddy's life hard you know ?,adult
gee Ross I've got a_lot_of work to do .,adult

is that pretending ?,adult
no that's not pretending .,adult
what were you you pretending ?,adult
I see .,adult
then he fell down for by accident .,adult
yeah and it was an accident .,adult
it was an accident .,adult
Mark ?,adult
what Mommy what ?,adult
are there six more shows .,adult
the third eye .,adult
.,adult
five and six more shows ?,adult
no wait .,adult
how many more shows ?,adult
that's not right .,adult
how many have they had so far ?,adult
and how many are left ?,adult
right .,adult
and what are there names ?,adult
?,adult
good .,adult
how many ?,adult
.,adult
he said there are two more left .,adult
oh .,adult
jump Mark jump .,adult
Ross ?,adult
don't push him don't push him .,adult
are there six shows ...,adult
in all .,adult
how many in all ?,adult
that's what I didn't want you to do .,adult
ow !,adult
I didn't push you !,adult
Ross do you know how to put the Under_Roo's away ?,adult
yeah just drop them in the right place .,adult
did you do a good job on it Ross ?,adult
okay .,adult
do you wanna have any tapes ?,adult
yeah .,adult
but I might leave anyway .,adult
so what are we going to have tapes or not ?,adult
how come ?,adult
okay good .,adult
Marky hasta have him first .,adult
well just go hide it in a place somewhere where no one will will find it .,adult
where Mommy and Daddy can't find it !,adult
well how are you going to remember in the morning where it is ?,adult
what do you mean ?,adult
Ross let's talk about whether you should give Sean the sword .,adult
now why don't you want this ?,adult
to be friends with another boy .,adult
you what ?,adult
but okay I understand what you are saying .,adult
but then how is Sean going to feel ?,adult
well think about how you feel when other have you ever ever been a kid and they don't play with you ?,adult
other kids won't play with you ?,adult
how does that feel ?,adult
you don't feel too bad in that situation ?,adult
just find another kid to play with ?,adult
and don't you need more that one kid to play with ?,adult
what if no one with play with you ?,adult
no one at all .,adult
what if your brother won't play with you ?,adult
brothers always play huh ?,adult
well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother wouldn't play ?,adult
that's smart Ross ...,adult
he's a smartalec isn't he ?,adult
so you think Sean should've done that because no one was being being nice to him he should've just left ?,adult
that's a good idea .,adult
so you don't ever wanna be nice to Sean huh ?,adult
how come ?,adult
well how about Grandma ?,adult
are you ever going to be nice to her ?,adult
she pokes you ?,adult
she doesn't always poke you .,adult
she likes you Ross .,adult
grandma really likes you .,adult
she buys presents for your birthday .,adult
what if she promised not to do that anymore ?,adult
what if we got Grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then ?,adult
no but what if she really stopped it ?,adult
no wait Ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her ?,adult
but you're going to get old someday too .,adult
well how old is your mommy ?,adult
because you should learn how old your mommy that's how you you should know .,adult
your mommy's thirty eight .,adult
when you write on the the Mothers Day present for her and on her birthday present you hafta to know how old she is .,adult
okay ?,adult
are you going to be mean to old people ?,adult
just because Grandma is old are you going to be mean to her ?,adult
think about it .,adult
you have your own body ?,adult
kind of but sometimes you hafta think about other people like like Sean and Grandma and ...,adult
no one makes you and you shouldn't yell .,adult
because I'll tell you the reason .,adult
do you remember about about God ?,adult
do you remember God ?,adult
okay God wanted people to be nice to each_other .,adult
you don't believe in God ?,adult
okay well then what makes you wanna be nice to other people ?,adult
yeah but what if other people were nasty to you ?,adult
and you wouldn't have any more friends .,adult
so maybe it's a good idea to be friends with kids .,adult
think about it .,adult
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody .,adult
let's think about a world where everyone is nice .,adult
I'm not bossing you .,adult
I'm asking you to use your head .,adult
you don't wanna think about other people huh ?,adult
you don't think about being nice to other children ?,adult
well think think about your own brain being nice to other kids .,adult
okay I'll tell you the rules .,adult
do you want me to tell you the rules ?,adult
then I should tell you beforehand ?,adult
okay every time you go to a party with kids .,adult
listen let me tell the whole rules ...,adult
I'll tell you the whole deal .,adult
whenever you go to a party with kids you hafta be nice to all the kids .,adult
when you go to school you hafta be nice to all the kids at school .,adult
and when you go on a picnic and a Boy Scout party you hafta be be nice to all those kids to and you'll hafta be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the Mall you hafta be nice to everybody .,adult
Ross that's not nice to your father .,adult
your father's heart is going to break Ross .,adult
yes .,adult
that's it and there'll be no more Father for you .,adult
well then you'll be nasty to her and her heart will break .,adult
but they're too old and you don't love them .,adult
well but if you don't love if you wanna just be nice to me I'm not really old and I don't poke my finger in you and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so I wouldn't die .,adult
you do ?,adult

maybe there is a commercial .,adult
and you said be .,adult
maybe what ?,adult
the third one ?,adult
what is the third one Ross ?,adult
the third set .,adult
okay what are the first two sets of He_man ?,adult
what what are the other sets of He_man ?,adult
what set is this Ross ?,adult
yeah you already said Battle_Cat .,adult
okay and what's the the second bunch .,adult
what does it mean in_between ?,adult
how do you know that it's in_between .,adult
how do you know that it's in_between .,adult
why isn't he ...,adult
why isn't he in the first bunch .,adult
why isn't he in the first bunch ?,adult
why isn't Fakir in the first bunch ?,adult
Fakir ?,adult
yeah why isn't Fakir in the first bunch ?,adult
he came when did he come out ?,adult
uhhuh .,adult
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch ?,adult
he's the last one of the first bunch .,adult
but where do you see him ?,adult
where do and when they make ads where do they put Fakir ?,adult
they don't add him anymore .,adult
and what is the third bunch ?,adult
and what is the third bunch ?,adult
but don't you think that Zoar might be Flier_Bird ?,adult
what does Zoar do ?,adult
what would he be ?,adult
okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch .,adult
what are they ?,adult
supposing I didn't know about them ?,adult
oh you don't me to tell you don't want me to tell .,adult
but you know something .,adult
Ross that you didn't figure out .,adult
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they useta have on the back did Fakir ever get in those ?,adult
are you sure ?,adult
is Fakir in the second bunch ?,adult
so they never put Fakir in any of the bunches .,adult
yeah the did .,adult
you made a mistake Ross .,adult
at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak Fakir into into those pictures .,adult
yup they did .,adult
no it won't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we didn't save that .,adult
how would that prove it ?,adult
where are we going to find that ?,adult
you mean at the toy store ?,adult
I know how you can tell .,adult
the toys have numbers .,adult
issue numbers .,adult
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers .,adult
you can compare the numbers .,adult
but the interesting thing is that Ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why I just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy Barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys .,adult
I'm sure that there will be a third wave .,adult
you mean roots ?,adult
an orchid .,adult
isn't he a terrible little brother ?,adult
why isn't he as bad as I think he is ?,adult
but he does understand some things .,adult
I do understand .,adult
do you understand Mark ?,adult
yes .,adult
he does understand ?,adult
what does he not understand ?,adult
no earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things .,adult
no it makes two infinities and eight .,adult
and that is an unreal number .,adult
that's a fantasy number .,adult
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number ?,adult
because you could never really get there in reality .,adult
in reality you can get to infinity .,adult
right because you'd hafta live forever .,adult
yes .,adult
so it's fantasy .,adult
infinity is fantasy .,adult
good_night .,adult

I sure hope Todd and his family don't get here too late and miss it .,adult
if they do we'll hafta tell them about the exciting part they missed .,adult
one of the guys disappeared just like the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz .,adult

oh really ?,adult
how about Marian ?,adult
Marian didn't do it ?,adult
you go one two three four five six seven eight .,adult
you you count that way .,adult
people would get very confused if you went that way .,adult
it wouldn't work out well .,adult
you could make it up too if you want .,adult
do they still check you for lice at preschool ?,adult
"Ross was pretending he's a servant , he said ""/.",adult
at your servants ?,adult
"at your servants , my King .",adult
"instead of at your service , right ?",adult
which one is it ?,adult

"at your servants , my King .",adult
the real word is service .,adult
no why Ross ?,adult
from your service my King ?,adult
right .,adult
that's cute Ross .,adult
what is a servant ?,adult
what does a servant do ?,adult
kind of like a slave ?,adult

there okay ?,adult
we're the the kings right ?,adult
but I'm the one that has glasses .,adult
what happened here ?,adult

good Marky good .,adult
he really is doing well isn't he ?,adult
when you were a little three years there were were some things you could do better than what Marky can do now .,adult
like you could tell long stories about Star Wars .,adult
no and why is that ?,adult
and when do you think they're going to stop ?,adult
okay and how about when Return of the Jedi is finished ?,adult
I see .,adult

wasn't that a joke about Little John ?,adult
is it the same kind of joke ?,adult
do you think it's a funny joke ?,adult
what if I called you He_Man .,adult
it would be a joke .,adult
it would just sort of be because you're not really a huge muscleman yet .,adult
what if I called you Darth Vader ?,adult
but what if I said that I was just playing a game would it be funny then ?,adult
but it would be like fantasy then .,adult
it's hard to tell the difference between humor and fantasy .,adult

what's wrong Mark ?,adult
now which story do you wanna hear about the machines ?,adult
okay about a long time ago .,adult
how did it start ?,adult
you don't remember the story ?,adult
well don't you remember part of the first part ?,adult
uhhuh and what did the cavemen have ?,adult
uhhuh and what things didn't they have ?,adult
tell me some things that they didn't have .,adult
yeah .,adult
and what did they do with those big thick sticks ?,adult
mhm know what those things were called ?,adult
clubs .,adult
yeah .,adult
yes they are .,adult
okay you wanna hear some more stories about them ?,adult
sure that's another tool they made they took a piece of skin from an animal .,adult
a real long piece and they put it into a stick from a tree .,adult
and then at the very back they put a stone .,adult
and they pulled it back back and then it shot .,adult
shot it like that .,adult
or sometimes they'd wrap it around slinging it around and let it fly .,adult
uhhuh they're both called slingshots okay .,adult
in the old days yes .,adult
there were many enemies to the people sometimes there were other people who were enemies and sometimes wild animals .,adult
did you know about that ?,adult
that's true do you think they fought with dinosaurs ?,adult
no not with really .,adult
that's a mistake .,adult
the dinosaurs were long before when the dinosaurs walked on the earth there were no people .,adult
no but sabertooth tigers and wooly mammoths did woolly mammoths lived with the caveman and they were huge .,adult
yes they were real they were real .,adult
you think so .,adult
that's just in Flintstones .,adult
how do you know ?,adult
oh they were still just monkeys ?,adult
maybe so okay now .,adult
so they were there .,adult
okay now you wanna hear the rest of the story ?,adult
okay now first thing those people did Ross when they wanted to eat they would hafta hunt and kill an animal and then eat the flesh that's right and that's of course a_lot_of work first of all right ?,adult
and also kinda yucky right .,adult
okay .,adult
but now how did they get out_of the caves out_of the stone age what did they do ?,adult
do you have any idea ?,adult
no .,adult
to get out_of the caves ?,adult
no .,adult
you know what they did ?,adult
that was very important ?,adult
the most important thing of all .,adult
fire .,adult
they learned how to make fire .,adult
would you guys know why is that so because they used the fire to make to make iron .,adult
iron and bronze and metals so they could make metal they took the dirt .,adult
and they burned hot hot fires and the hot fires made the dirt into strong knives .,adult
and into guns and into a shovels .,adult
no they could make shovels they took things and they made big tools with the fire that's why fire was very important Ross and Mark did you know that Marky ?,adult
what ?,adult
why ?,adult
then they could dig caves but you know what else they could do with a shovel ?,adult
dig holes to plant plants .,adult
or they could make a palace they could build big buildings you see .,adult
mhm .,adult
mhm .,adult
mhm .,adult
right .,adult
right and so these people worked very hard they made these tools and now you know what they could do next ?,adult
they started to make machines do you know what kind of machines they could make ?,adult
first they could make machines to lift things like big pulleys and things like so you can lift them up on top of the building and they made big huge wagons so they could carry things you heard about the wheel do you know what the wheel does ?,adult
the wheel makes it so you can roll wagons with big wheels can roll down the hill .,adult
daddy .,adult
mhm .,adult
now we getting to the cowboy part aren't we ?,adult

yeah .,adult
and he had swords .,adult
yeah .,adult
and they had guns .,adult
yeah .,adult
oh they just starting they were just starting making the they didn't have guns yet but they did have swords .,adult
forest weapons .,adult
okay .,adult
okay now came .,adult
right .,adult
no .,adult
because they didn't have gun powder yet .,adult
gun powder came from .,adult
middle ages .,adult
okay well they had the forest weapons and they could build a_lot_of shovels and axes but they still didn't know how to make big machines and then came the time of the great machines and people started building machines to do lift /.,adult
oh okay well oh and there was armor I forgot to tell you about armor .,adult
a knights in armor useta have masks on their head made of steel Marky do you know like He_Man and Man_at_arms have masks made of steel and they have all covered with steel .,adult
mhm .,adult
but those are still not machines they're just weapons and tools okay ?,adult
think of a machine what is a machine ?,adult
yeah .,adult
okay .,adult
so four forty four comes back that's a machine .,adult
okay and then people said hey if we can make shovels then we can make guns and knives I bet we can make something really really fancy .,adult
bicycles !,adult
they could make bicycles and they could make all sorts of little machines called clocks they started to make clocks and all little pieces started to move around and then they made machines to cut up to cut up to grind flour and make flour and machines to go out in the fields and pick the cotton and then they made cars Ross and Mark they built cars .,adult
now we getting to our time .,adult
right now we get in to our time and they make cars .,adult
and they started to make boats with engines .,adult
and the engines went vrrooom vrrrooom and they really had machines okay ?,adult
and then what happened next see if you can tell me the rest of the story .,adult
what else did they make ?,adult
no rivers are not machines .,adult

"I told Ross that it wouldn't be fair to cry just because I'm giving a Trono to another boy , that's Adam Just , he shouldn't cry because it makes me think that he doesn't want the other boy to have something nice .",adult
and what did you say then Ross ?,adult
"actually he said ""/.",adult
"you know , the set up of the double hypothetical just think what if .",adult
and I never could have gotten one .,adult
how would that have happened Ross ?,adult
oh I see .,adult
I see .,adult
you think it might have worked that way ?,adult
mhm .,adult
I see .,adult
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the Trono was for you .,adult
and why did you think that ?,adult
"and you said I ""/.",adult
you said you wouldn't have hided it or wouldn't have hid if it had been for me .,adult
isn't that what you said ?,adult
how did you say it Ross ?,adult
because it was yours I would have hid it away ?,adult
do you think it's somebody else's ?,adult
why do you think that ?,adult
no no !,adult
okay you say that you think it's for you .,adult
why do you think it's for you ?,adult
and why did you think so in the first place ?,adult
what was the reason ?,adult
no the reason was that you said that I didn't tell you who it was for .,adult
"if I was hiding it from you then it was sure to be yours because if it was for Adam I wouldn't try to hide it , would I ?",adult
uhhuh .,adult
so do you still think that reasoning is good ?,adult
do you still think that's good thinking or have you changed your mind now ?,adult
who do you think it's for ?,adult
uhhuh .,adult
if it's for Adam then why not show it to you right ?,adult
then I do show it to you ?,adult
uhhuh .,adult
well I'm not going to show it to you so what does that mean ?,adult
you think now it's for you .,adult
are you sure of that ?,adult
maybe I'm just hiding it from Adam .,adult
so you think that's a pretty good okay .,adult
so how do you feel about it ?,adult
who's it for at this point ?,adult
who would you guess ?,adult
who would you guess if you hadta guess ?,adult
is it for Ross or for Adam .,adult
you're not sure now .,adult
now daddy keeps on telling you it's for Adam right ?,adult
so you can't make up your mind can you ?,adult
well it's tough isn't it .,adult
what ?,adult
no way .,adult
daddy's are not supposed to tell .,adult
daddy's /.,adult
how do you know that ?,adult
mhm .,adult
you know something Ross ?,adult
you're right .,adult
you're right .,adult
it's for you .,adult
yes .,adult
it is .,adult
it's for you .,adult
you guessed it .,adult
because if I hide it there's no way that I would hide something that is for Adam if it's for Adam why should I hide it right ?,adult
the only reason I should hide it is because I don't want you little kids to see it .,adult
you got it right .,adult
you got the right answer .,adult
yes son .,adult
what ?,adult
Trono ?,adult
yeah I know the whole story .,adult
it's the first book of Tron before there was Tron .,adult

your real mommy is a lovely woman .,adult
just does not run momma's .,adult

I know .,adult
.,adult
I'm not sure whether I recorded this or not from yesterday .,adult
but I think I should .,adult
I was telling Ross yesterday that ...,adult
wait a second /.,adult
I'm having a_little trouble with this recording level .,adult
I think I'll turn it down .,adult
hold on .,adult
hi .,adult
okay ‡ I'm gonna record down at a lower level .,adult
record at a lower /.,adult
oh ‡ there we go .,adult
okay .,adult
yesterday I was telling Ross that I caught him lying .,adult
now ‡ I'm trying to remember what the lie was that I caught him doing .,adult
oh ‡ yes .,adult
"he said ""/.",adult
I asked him how many cookies he had .,adult
and he said he had had two .,adult
and he was on his third .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
you mean three .,adult
you're on your third now „ right ?,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
yeah ‡ I was just checking to see if you knew .,adult
or something he said .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
Ross ‡ don't lie to me .,adult
you_know parents know an awful lot .,adult
and they can catch their little children when they lie .,adult
and I really don't like it when you lie .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
yeah ‡ I /.,adult
"so ‡ before this I said ""/.",adult
you mean three you've had ?,adult
yes ‡ yes ‡ I've had three .,adult
"he said "".",adult
"he corrected himself to say ""/.",adult
yes ‡ I've had three .,adult
so_that he cleaned up his lie a little bit .,adult
and then I went through the spin of parents can tell if children have lies .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
yeah ‡ I know parents can find lies .,adult
that's why I changed and told the truth .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
you know Ross it's not worth it to lie because parents know a_lot_of things so they can find out when they make lies .,adult
and you_know and so Ross interpreted this not as a thing that he should watch out for or worry about because parents are always going to find out his lies but as a statement about parental skills being more than children's skills .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
yeah ‡ well ‡ you can't learn how to break dance .,adult
.,adult
of_course because it's true .,adult
it is parental skills .,adult
right ‡ it is parental skills .,adult
"and he wanted to point out that ""/.",adult
okay ‡ so ‡ you're so great .,adult
you can tell about lies .,adult
but I can breakdance .,adult
well ‡ what would be the other way of him proving it ?,adult
oh ‡ well ‡ I'll watch /.,adult
you have a good point .,adult
I'll try not to /.,adult
"the other was point would ""/.",adult
I'll try not to lie because it is /.,adult
you're right .,adult
it is a good idea in life not to get caught .,adult
and it's you_know it was to take it as an admonition rather than as a challenge .,adult
he took it as a challenge to his ability .,adult
.,adult
he may have taken it as an admonition too .,adult
right .,adult
but then he had a real gleam in his eye .,adult
well ‡ I can /.,adult
and he thought he was so cute showing that something that he could do .,adult
but anyway //.,adult
you hadn't gotten on top of him .,adult
he certainly /.,adult
I hadn't gotten on top of him .,adult
that was the thing .,adult
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .,adult
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .,adult
and he's certainly working to maintain a full conversational presence .,adult
maintain .,adult
I think would be a full persona .,adult
uhhuh .,adult
he did pretty well .,adult
I_mean he didn't quite make it through because he missed the point .,adult
tell them about his little conversation with Mark and Ross's interaction with us .,adult
oh ‡ Ross .,adult
on the side of well this conversation about Mark telling us about his dream witch .,adult
talking about a witch or ...,adult
Ross said ...,adult
he didn't say anything „ did he ?,adult

and laughing along with the two of us .,adult
"he said ""/.",adult
yeah .,adult
no ‡ he did say one thing .,adult
"he said something about ""/.",adult
she wasn't your real mom „ was she ?,adult
real mom wouldn't act like that „ would she ?,adult
haw haw haw .,adult
ha ha ha .,adult
in other words mommy //.,adult
he sort_of understood that dreams do reflect a little bit of reality .,adult
and that isn't it cute that Mark isn't in on that yet ?,adult
yeah ‡ well ‡ you and I were kind_of smiling at each_other .,adult
and he picked up on that .,adult
right ‡ right ‡ we were smiling .,adult
and he picked up on that .,adult
and in the same tenor he actually sort_of verbalized a little bit about it with //.,adult
he was in the know .,adult
yeah ‡ he was //.,adult
with his parents .,adult
with his parents about little baby brother .,adult
.,adult
isn't it cute ?,adult
he does a_lot_of that .,adult
.,adult
"Marky came up the stairs and said ""/.",adult
I'm homesick .,adult
"and Ross said ""/.",adult
you are at home .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
I'm homesick not seasick .,adult
because I'm at home and because_of my swishing around head .,adult
I guess he had probably came up the stairs too fast and feeling dizzy .,adult
who knows what he was doing .,adult
.,adult
and oh at last I get to go to the bathroom .,adult
.,adult
Mark drew a maze .,adult
and he showed me a star at the top of the page .,adult

"and I said ""/.",adult
"well ‡ maybe his head feels hard , inside hard .",adult

and he says it feels hard on one side .,adult
.,adult
Mark well he had the nurse call .,adult
and she called me today .,adult
do you wanna play what I'm playing ?,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
because I wasn't feeling good .,adult
I had a hard head .,adult

he turns into //.,adult
.,adult
Mark went to the cat drawer and pulled out some catnip .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
well ‡ this will work him up .,adult

"except for we do say it to Ross when we say ""/.",adult
watch out .,adult

but we don't use that word any other time .,adult

a_lot_of them were unpronounceable .,adult
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just throw letters together and some how they'll make a word .,adult
this is very much like when he was a little baby he useta sort of make up words even though they didn't really mean anything sort of to describe some unspecifiable thing .,adult
now he is writing them out .,adult
Mary says that she useta do that when she was a kid .,adult
now I certainly never remember doing any thing like that .,adult
she also remembers taking pictures to people and asking them what they were .,adult
again I'd never do I mean any where near like that .,adult
I can never did anything in fact that I can remember that was very fantasy oriented at all .,adult
"well let's see we were , .",adult

what'd you say ?,adult
I already had a glass ?,adult
which means that /.,adult
you knew it was okay because /.,adult
I already had some and I liked it .,adult
"I already had some and I liked it , yeah .",adult
you'd already poured me a glass and you knew it was okay at that point .,adult

so why are you checking for the consistency at a later point .,adult
it couldn't have changed by now .,adult
I asked Ross could you be a little nicer and he said I hate being nice .,adult

but I've never noticed before .,adult
Mary told him to do something .,adult

oh .,adult
a relative clause that has sort_of /.,adult
"yeah the structure is ""/.",adult

I don't know .,adult
help me put tiles on real quick .,adult
Marky ‡ Daddy could use that clean sponge .,adult
I could use that .,adult
I could use that clean sponge .,adult
.,adult
it's starting to get into my eyes .,adult
my eyes are starting to get it .,adult
.,adult
burning ?,adult
yeah .,adult
I need the clean sponge .,adult
this'll be enough for now .,adult
I need the clean sponge .,adult
.,adult
.,adult
maybe Mark shouldn't be in here .,adult
why ?,adult
might be burning into his /.,adult
his eyes might get too burny from it .,adult
oh .,adult
.,adult
.,adult
can you open the door Mark ?,adult
mhm .,adult
I'll do it .,adult
you or I ?,adult
I'll do it .,adult
oh .,adult
.,adult
yeah ‡ but it's better than having my eyes burn out .,adult
oh .,adult
do you want me to turn it off ?,adult
that really cools the air through here though .,adult
do you want me to turn it off ?,adult
what do you mean off ?,adult
oh ‡ yeah ‡ you can turn the tape recorder off .,adult
.,adult
today is May eighth .,adult
May eighth .,adult
and Mary's gonna tell how Ross rescued her .,adult
okay .,adult
well ‡ Brian came in the door .,adult
mhm .,adult
and was upset because the grout wasn't finished .,adult
hm .,adult
and Ross told Brian not to /.,adult
what'd he say ?,adult
not to be hard on me ?,adult
yeah ‡ something like that .,adult
basically that .,adult
"I mean ""/.",adult
don't be so hard on mother .,adult
she's had a rough day .,adult
"I said ""/.",adult
why ?,adult
and Brian questioned him .,adult
wasn't gonna let him slide with an easy explanation .,adult
yeah .,adult
"anyway ‡ so ‡ Brian said ""/.",adult
why ?,adult
"and I think Ross said ""/.",adult
don't ask .,adult
didn't he ?,adult
yeah .,adult
"or ""/.",adult
she just did .,adult
she had a rough day .,adult
she had a hard day .,adult
right .,adult
but anyway the whole idea was that Ross really ...,adult
all by himself .,adult
it was not a put up job .,adult
right .,adult
he defended me .,adult
defended hm .,adult
well ‡ he said that you had had a ...,adult
"I asked him ""/.",adult
what was so hard ?,adult
what was so hard about mom's day ?,adult
"yeah ‡ and she said ""/.",adult
I asked what was so hard .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
well ‡ she hadta spend all her time with us .,adult
and we kept her very busy .,adult
which is probably true .,adult
is that true Mary ?,adult
had you taken them to get doughnuts or something ?,adult
yeah .,adult
no ‡ I hadn't taken them anywhere .,adult
.,adult
anyway he ...,adult
yeah .,adult
but they see you spend a_lot_of time messing with the boys .,adult
and that's why she hadn't had time to do the grouting .,adult
that's probably true .,adult
I'd say it's not the first time .,adult
but it's certainly the clearest time Ross has ever come to someone's defense „ right ?,adult
"yeah , yeah .",adult
in totally instigated by himself .,adult
and did it very convincingly .,adult
yeah ‡ and we think that he's been getting practice at school with a kid who's been picked on by everyone else .,adult
and Ross has befriended this particular child .,adult
we know that from his teacher that Ross has been very supportive of a new kid at school in class who's been having troubles .,adult
like he's been running away from the playground and stuff .,adult
and Ross has befriended this kid .,adult
and I guess he's been explaining his actions to the other kids .,adult
and telling the other kids to not treat him so rough .,adult
because the other kids have been treating the new kid making fun of him .,adult
right .,adult
so ‡ we I guess we suspect that Ross has been getting practice and is getting really good at defending the underdog .,adult
.,adult
Mark was responding to a story .,adult
I was reading a story about a little boy who said mean things to another boy .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
you know what ?,adult
I'd really like to kick him .,adult
I mean you know I /.,adult
I kind_of frowned .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
you know I'm glad he's not in real life .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
uhhuh .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
you know what ?,adult
I really ...,adult
you_know I had fun at Aaron's house .,adult
I don't know what that meant .,adult
I really don't .,adult
but in any case that's the way Mark's mind works .,adult
.,adult
Mark to put on his socks .,adult
"and he says ""/.",adult
"he said ""/.",adult
I'm putting on them .,adult
he says that very typical error .,adult
and I'm surprised to see he's still making them .,adult
Marky you're a little baby .,adult
you wanna go pee in the toilet ?,adult
or you wanna go pee in your bed ?,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
oh ‡ that's funny Daddy .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
I'm glad I didn't go poop ...,adult
I'm glad I didn't go poop like when I was a little baby and I went poop on our rug .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
do you remember that Mark ?,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
oh ‡ yeah ‡ I remember that .,adult
"I said ""/.",adult
why'd you do it Mark ?,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
I don't know why .,adult
I was just a little bad boy .,adult
.,adult
and he laughed .,adult
no .,adult
and then it was very clear that he didn't remember this .,adult
I was just /.,adult
I was just /.,adult
I was just a little bit too dumb .,adult
this is something he did when he was two .,adult
yeah ‡ and do you have any reason why you did it ?,adult
I don't know .,adult
maybe it was just poop in .,adult
do you know how old you were ?,adult
do you know how old you were ?,adult
two .,adult
you just turned two .,adult
maybe not even two about one and a half .,adult
you were pretty young .,adult
you really remember it „ huh ?,adult
it's true we did have a rug then .,adult
yeah .,adult
so ...,adult
but it was blue .,adult
except it was a little bit darker .,adult
yeah .,adult
no ‡ it wasn't blue .,adult
Mark it was brown .,adult
now ‡ let's go to bed .,adult
yeah ‡ it was .,adult
"Mark said ""/.",adult
if you stood up in the north in one place for five years you'd die .,adult
"I said ""/.",adult
yeah ‡ from the freezing cold .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
how'd you like to live up in the frozen arctic ?,adult
"he said ""/.",adult
no way .,adult
"Ross said ""/.",adult
how do the Eskimos do it ?,adult
how do the Eskimos do it ?,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
they're tough .,adult
and they wear a_lot_of clothes .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
how'd you like to live in the burning hot desert ?,adult
"and they said ""/.",adult
no way .,adult
"and Ross said ""/.",adult
I think we'll stay right here .,adult
let's stay right here in Pittsburgh .,adult
right here .,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
in Pittsburgh .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
yeah .,adult
"and Marky said ""/.",adult
except that then we would get involved in the army .,adult
so ‡ it was just if you were in the desert you wouldn't get involved in the army „ right Mark ?,adult
is that what you meant Mark ?,adult
and you wouldn't get involved in drunks .,adult
in drunks ?,adult
yeah .,adult
drugs .,adult
mkay .,adult
is that true ?,adult
mhm .,adult
and you won't get involved in guns or or ...,adult

"and Mark said ""/.",adult
do all /.,adult
"he said ""/.",adult
do all countries have armies ?,adult
no ‡ not the little ones .,adult
they don't have armies .,adult
then we can take them over .,adult
well ‡ we're very careful .,adult
some countries we're very careful with .,adult
but you're right .,adult
the reason that they have armies is because people think that you can take them over .,adult
take them over ?,adult
and in the old days the armies made some sense .,adult
but now people have nuclear bombs .,adult
in the old //.,adult
mhm .,adult
and then that would be the end of the problems „ right ?,adult
I know .,adult
we've thought about that .,adult
but they don't think that we mean business .,adult
they think we're just trying to trick them .,adult
yeah ‡ they do .,adult
they think we're just trying to trick them .,adult
you_know our country's pretty good .,adult
but you_know we dropped a nuclear bomb on some people once .,adult
we did ?,adult
we did .,adult
we dropped it on the Japanese .,adult
they're pretty an enemy right now I guess .,adult

no ‡ one of our country did it .,adult
they had a war .,adult

you bet it's hot .,adult
you bet your boody it's hot .,adult
that's cause they boil these things before they put them out .,adult
you bet your boodies .,adult
no the glass gets hotter than the plastic honey .,adult
because glass conducts heat .,adult
and plastic is an insulator .,adult
because it's not made of glass it's porcelain .,adult
no way .,adult
it's made of china .,adult
there's a difference .,adult
china china and glass are both based on sand .,adult
they both come from sand but china has more lime in it .,adult

we'll send some money back to them to pay for it .,adult
that's just to be honest .,adult

well .,adult
too easily .,adult

right .,adult
run for it /.,adult
I'd say also Mondale still has a chance but it's a very very slim chance .,adult
pretty slim .,adult
it's pretty slim .,adult

uhuh but how about the other kids ?,adult
did they want Charlie to win ?,adult

uhuh ?,adult
I see okay .,adult

what did he think he was going to do ?,adult
right and so he can't do it .,adult

that's not so interesting yeah /.,adult
I think you're right so you wanna tell the whole story again one more time ?,adult
yeah let's tell it one more time so daddy will listen to it /.,adult
cause you hafta do a real good job when you're up there in front of the class .,adult
well I think what's the most funny part of the story ?,adult

I think its when Linus talks and also what does Lucy do to get people to vote for Linus ?,adult
what did she do ?,adult
you oughta tell them about that okay ?,adult
okay tell them about that so what are you going to say ?,adult
how did Lucy get people to vote for her brother ?,adult

yeah .,adult
yeah and one day Linus had been good to him yeah .,adult
and what of the other kids what'd she do to them ?,adult
third kid ?,adult
"yeah but Russell Anderson said ""/.",adult
I'm running against him /.,adult
so he wasn't voting but he ended up voting for him anyway .,adult
okay so that's the funny part and the other funny part is when Linus says instead of giving a speech he's gonna tell them about the great pumpkin .,adult
and that made him lose a_lot_of votes don't you think ?,adult
because .,adult
thought it was funny .,adult
yeah he's a pretty good comedian .,adult
and because what did Lucy say ?,adult

now ‡ Marky asked me about why did the volcanoes hafta erupt „ Ross .,adult
what do you know about that ?,adult
what ?,adult
Marky asked why did the volcanoes hafta erupt .,adult
because the earth was too warm inside .,adult
yeah ‡ that's true but Marky had the right answer .,adult
that's how they made land but that's not why they made land .,adult
there's another thing that I want to tell you about .,adult
it's not very polite at the table though .,adult
the earth was full of gas .,adult
hadta burp .,adult
that's what volcanoes are .,adult
it's when the earth is burping .,adult
really ‡ volcanic eruptions are caused largely by gas .,adult
hot gas .,adult
mhm .,adult
now that's not true of lava flows but when they actually blow I think //.,adult
actually it's a_little more complicated than that .,adult
but gas really is involved .,adult
more „ please .,adult
see ‡ there's pressure inside .,adult
pressure inside the earth .,adult
"because it's very hot inside , did you know that ?",adult
you know about the devil ?,adult
do you think he's real ?,adult
unhunh .,adult
how do we know he's not real ?,adult
because you hafta be underground .,adult
because that's where mud is .,adult

mhm .,adult
and they know that he can't live there .,adult
why ?,adult
yeah .,adult

that's what scientists say .,adult
oh ‡ to come closer .,adult
"no ‡ all the world was compressed into very small space , so tiny that noone could stand it .",adult
there weren't any people .,adult
all there were were molecules and pieces of matter .,adult
everything in the whole world was compressed very tight „ okay ?,adult
and it got so tight that it went bang „ okay ?,adult
"and it blew everything out into the world , stardust all over the world .",adult
and then /.,adult
I thought there wasn't any world then .,adult
then all the stardust came together and formed planets and stars and started to cool .,adult
it was very hot .,adult
so there is such thing as stardust .,adult
mhm oh yeah .,adult
my teacher keeps saying there isn't any .,adult
stardust .,adult
she doesn't understand what you mean by stardust .,adult

yeah .,adult
and nitrogen is in the air too „ nitrogen .,adult
"argon , xenon , those are sort_of rare .",adult
"but that stuffie on the ground , gravity , it keeps you down .",adult
but in space there's no gravity so you go up and down like that .,adult
right ‡ that's right .,adult
"and in space there's no air to breathe , no oxygen , no nitrogen /.",adult
yeah ‡ so you need a little spacesuit on .,adult
mhm .,adult
got a bunch of oxygen on your back .,adult

right ‡ you know what they eat for lunch when Rossy goes to eat lunch at school ?,adult
knuckle sandwiches .,adult
yeah ‡ they eat them for lunch .,adult
that's right .,adult
that's why Ross doesn't like to eat lunch there .,adult
yeah ‡ from people .,adult
no ‡ not really .,adult
no .,adult
they don't really eat knuckle sandwiches .,adult
"they're just plain regular sandwiches that regular people eat , like peanutbutter and jelly and stuff like that „ right ?",adult
Marky ‡ can I ask you a question ?,adult
how_come there are so many pairs of socks in the wash ?,adult
you know how many pairs of boy's socks there are in the wash ?,adult
now ‡ who puts all these socks in the wash ?,adult
could you tell me ?,adult
and how_come there are so many pairs of underpants in the wash ?,adult
what kinda problems „ darling ?,adult
you did ?,adult
I didn't notice you peed in your pants .,adult
you just made up your problem .,adult
when did you do that ?,adult
and that's why you put all these pants in the wash ?,adult
Marky ‡ I don't think it's true .,adult
I don't think you really peed in your pants .,adult
you did ?,adult
did it drip on the floor ?,adult
then it didn't really happen ‡ did it ?,adult
how much ?,adult
"when did it happen , when you were at school ?",adult
why didn't you just go to the bathroom ?,adult
couldn't hurry up ?,adult
and this happens every day ?,adult
does this happen every day or just sometimes ?,adult
well ‡ what_about the socks ?,adult
how do all those socks get in the wash ?,adult
now explain that one to me .,adult
well ‡ think about it .,adult
there are nine pairs of socks there .,adult
and this is one day's wash .,adult
now how do two boys use nine pairs of socks in a day ?,adult
hm ?,adult
explain that .,adult
well ‡ I don't know either .,adult
you know better than I do .,adult
you're the man who wears all the socks .,adult
come_on ‡ tell me the reasons .,adult
think about it .,adult
do you have games where you throw socks in the wash ?,adult
really ?,adult
maybe that's what made the problem „ huh ?,adult
no ?,adult
.,adult
mm ‡ I don't know but we're missing some socks .,adult
can you find any more socks anywhere ?,adult
oh ‡ I'm sorry .,adult
my apologies .,adult
"say ""/.",adult
that's okay „ Dada .,adult
I'm not mad at you „ Dada .,adult
Mark's gonna tell the taperecorder a story .,adult
go ahead „ Mark .,adult
you shouldn't stop it „ Mark .,adult
a button where ?,adult
.,adult
oh sure .,adult
alright .,adult
"few days back Mark and I went for the bus and because I was dashing for the bus in the car , he said ""/.",adult
I wish that some people didn't hafta sit in the car and listen to other people get mad at the bus .,adult
I wasn't even cursing the bus at that point but it's typical that I get down to the end of the street and the bus is already past and hasn't bothered to stop or anything and I curse out the bus .,adult
and so Mark has been trying to get me to stop saying anything about the bus even when we miss it by a hair .,adult
"Ross was talking about ""/.",adult
Dad ‡ you know that you're gonna be here on the first day of spring and Mom's gonna be in California ?,adult
"and I said ""/.",adult
yeah Ross ‡ I know .,adult
I looked at the calendar .,adult
that's right .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
but Dad you_know ‡ you hafta admit that Mommy makes better Valentine's day cakes .,adult
but we'll save some for you .,adult
this has to do with the fact //.,adult
what was interesting was sort_of the leap that he made which was connecting the fact that I'm going to be back for the first day of spring and that //.,adult
there was one other thing that went in_between those .,adult
"I said ""/.",adult
will you miss your mom ?,adult
"he said ""/.",adult
yeah ‡ sure we will .,adult
"and he said ""/.",adult
but Dad you_know ‡ you hafta admit that Mommy makes better Valentine's day cakes .,adult
but we'll save some for you when you get back .,adult
and what he's saying is //.,adult
not Valentine's day .,adult
Saint_Patrick's day cakes .,adult
I'm sorry .,adult
Saint_Patrick's day cakes .,adult
and /.,adult
he never mentioned Saint_Patricks before then ?,adult
no ‡ we had .,adult
we had talked before about the fact that I would be missing Saint_Patrick's day when I'm in Paris .,adult
going to Paris and Rome and I'd be missing Saint_Patrick's day .,adult
but I guess he figured out that he would save some things .,adult
"and so what he's saying is ""/.",adult
it's okay that we have Mother for Saint_Patrick's day and you for the first day of spring because after_all Mommy makes better Saint_Patrick's day cakes than you would .,adult
so that's appropriate that she should be there for Saint_Patrick's day .,adult
and don't worry „ Dad .,adult
we'll save you some .,adult
so it'll all be okay .,adult
"he's getting it all ready in his mind , how it's gonna be for various holidays and things when people are going to be going on trips .",adult
Ross climbed over the banister .,adult
and as he did I noticed that the banister cut him right between the legs .,adult
"and I gave him this rather startled look or concerned look and I said ""/.",adult
oo ‡ right on the privates .,adult
and by this time he was standing up and he looks me straight in the eye for a moment like he was trying to absorb what I said .,adult
"and then his face broke into a smile and he said ""/.",adult
oh ‡ I'm built like a monkey .,adult
oh ‡ it's okay .,adult
I'm built like a monkey .,adult
I don't get hurt .,adult
something like that .,adult
because he was shocked and then to cover up his shock he thought he could use a clever retort .,adult
"Marky said ""/.",adult
you_know Mom ‡ if we just clean up the fireplace this house would look really clean .,adult
he said this .,adult
he was in the kitchen .,adult
we hadn't been around the fireplace at all .,adult
right .,adult
this had nothing to do with the fireplace .,adult
it was some kind of an adult remark stolen straight from Brian but Brian wasn't around and this wasn't something that had been ...,adult
you_know ‡ this was Mark trying to act like he had everything under control .,adult
right ‡ cute .,adult
"saw a bunch of trophies at school today and he said ""/.",adult

on that side //.,adult
and he pointed to one side of the room .,adult

"and then he pointed to the other side of the room and he said ""/.",adult

this was something that was recorded I believe on the last tape .,adult
"and she said ""/.",adult
you_know ‡ it was a perfect use of it rhetorically .,adult
it's just the only place where the rhetorical use and the meaningful use that is of really resting something both could cooccur .,adult
"in other words , Mark could use it rhetorically correctly but didn't hafta use it metaphorically .",adult
"that is , the idea of resting a case metaphorically was not something he wanted to buy into yet .",adult
so he wanted to use it in a specifically undergeneralized way but still appropriate with the situation .,adult
today is August first and Name has come to visit .,adult
Mark is dancing around to the .,adult

with little hand movements .,adult
the more faster I fall asleep .,adult
"Mark was having trouble with reading some books that we got him and Mark said ""/.",adult
it's because the words are too little .,adult
"and Ross said ""/.",adult
the reason he can't read it is because he can't see the words on the page .,adult
so my suggestion is that when he wants to read the words you write them up on a piece of paper so that he can see them .,adult
"and what was interesting about that was this ""/.",adult
my suggestion is ...,adult
Mark's suggestion is ...,adult
business was well used .,adult
