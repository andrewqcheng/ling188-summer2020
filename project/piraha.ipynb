    "[Pirahã](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_language) is (in)famous in the field of linguistics for many reasons. One of the most prominent claims made about the language is a lack of an important syntactic phenomenon,  recursion. [Futrell et al. (2016)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145289) analyze a corpus of Pirahã and we're using their data here."
